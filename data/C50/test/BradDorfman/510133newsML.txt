The rise in profit margins was primarily due to higher prices, higher physical sales volume, a favourable change in geographic sales mix, lower sales discounts and the net effect of the stronger dollar.

Sales inside the United States were . billion, up percent from a year ago. Sales outside the United States were . billion, up percent from a year ago. Sales volume in the quarter was up percent, while prices improved percent, Caterpillar said. While results were far better than expected for the quarter, analysts expressed some concern about how much the stronger dollar aided results.

Also, if the dollar remains too strong vs. the yen, the company could be forced to cut prices because of competition from Japanese companies, Caterpillar said.
