Britain was a step closer to completing the privatisation of passenger rail services on Thursday after announcing the preferred bidders for two more franchises which helped send the companies' shares soaring. The Office of Passenger Rail Franchising Opraf said Great Western Holdings Ltd had been chosen as the preferred bidder for the North West Regional Railways franchise in northwest England. Existing management and employees own percent of the bid group, with FirstBus and i venture capital owning . percent each. The Thameslink franchise was awarded to GOVIA which comprises of Go Ahead Group Plc and French transport group VIA GTI. That leaves just three of the total franchises to be awarded ahead of the deadline for the British election due by May .

The franchise sales will completes the controversial privatisation of Britain's rail industry which began in and included the sell off of rail infrastructure under Railtrack and the sale of the three rolling stock leasing companies.

He said finalisation of the deal could add million pounds million of extra revenue to Go Ahead's figures. We aim to capitalise on our existing commuter traffic and improve the links to the airports. There is enormous scope, he said pointing to the example of the fast link Gatwick Express service from Victoria which serves the West London travellers. Opraf also announced that a revised shortlist for Central Trains had been drawn up, cutting the orignal list of five to National Express Group and Straightforward Lines which contains FirstBus and the existing management team. FirstBus chairman, Trevor Smallwood, said whoever won the Central deal, which covers routes in central England, could see revenues of around million pounds. His company must now make renewed presentations against National Express in a fight to the finish. A final decision is expected in the next two weeks when financial details of each deal will be revealed including the service, investment and subsidy levels for the franchise term.
