Lucent said it benefited from strengthened relationships with the regional Bell companies that followed its spin off from AT amp T a year ago.

Lucent said continuing demand for second telephone lines in businesses and residences for uses such as Internet access, data traffic and fax services contributed to solid gains in sales of wireless systems, switching systems and related software.
