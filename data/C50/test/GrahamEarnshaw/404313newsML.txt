One of Shanghai's top businessmen said on Wednesday that he had no doubts or concerns about policy changes following the death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping last week. All we want is stable government, said Zhang Xuexiong whose chocolate making company is a major supplier of confectionary to the Shanghai market and one of the city's largest private companies. The rest we can handle with our own hands. Zhang is the owner of the Shanghai Haolaixi Food Co Ltd, which he started in with , yuan , in capital. It turned a , yuan profit in the first year and he hasn't looked back since. Last year, the company had a profit of over one million yuan, which Zhang said he expects to rise to over three million in . Party chief Jiang Zemin said quite clearly in his eulogy to Deng that multiple forms of production would continue to be allowed. There will definitely be no change in policy, he said. Zhang was effusive in his praise of Deng and his contribution to making him a millionaire. If the policy had not opened up, we simply wouldn't exist, he said. Deng Xiaoping saw that it was essential to let people become prosperous before they would continue to support the rule of the Communist Party. The company has workers, but in a classic capitalist entrepreneurial move, Zhang plans to fire more than half of them later this year when he installs automatic packaging machinery imported from the United States. Zhang, aged , was one of many young people shipped out of Shanghai to work in the countryside during the Cultural Revolution. He returned to his native city in , and started a series of small restaurants and shops. But private enterprise was very tough in the s, especially in Shanghai. It was only after Comrade Deng's speech in opening up economic development that things got moving, he said.
