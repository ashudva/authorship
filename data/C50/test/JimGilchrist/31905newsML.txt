The decision by Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd to buy three more Airbus Industrie A long range aircraft will increase the airline's air cargo opportunities, according to a senior Cathay cargo executive. Ray Jewell, cargo marketing and sales manager for Cathay Pacific Cargo, told Reuters in an interview that the new aircraft will be able to fly between and tonnes of belly space cargo plus passengers in normal weather conditions from Hong Kong to Toronto. Other possible destinations for the new aircraft from Hong Kong to Europe are still being studied, he added. The A 's ability to fly ultra long distances will mean some existing routes become non stop destinations, Jewell said. These new aircraft will certainly help us on the air cargo side of things, there is no question about that. We are very pleased with our existing A s which are very cargo friendly and fuel efficient along with our Boeing s, Jewell said. Cathay currently have four A and three A in its fleet. The new Airbus A models are due to be delivered in the second and third quarters of to coincide with the opening of Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok and increased flight schedules. Chek Lap Kok will definitely open things up for us and for other airlines which at the moment are restricted for slots at Kai Tak. The new airport is a major factor in planning and strategy. The increased cargo opportunities go hand in hand, Jewell added. Air Cargo Newsroom Tel Fax
