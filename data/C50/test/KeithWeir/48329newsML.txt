British television and newspaper group United News amp Media posted a profit rise of more than percent on Thursday and said it had made significant progress since a merger earlier this year effectively doubled its size. Pre tax profit before exceptional items from the group totalled . million pounds . million in the six months to June , against last year's restated figure of million. Market reaction to the figures was broadly favourable, United shares closing p higher at . p. The figures were the first since a merger between United News amp Media and television and financial services group MAI. The merger, completed in April, created a company with a market capitalisation of more than three billion pounds. The group owns British national newspapers The Daily and Sunday Express and Daily Star and operates commercial television ITV franchises in southern and eastern England. Share analysts said that extensive restructuring meant that most of the merger benefits would not feed through until next year and some complained that the results were unnecessarily hard to decipher. There are huge exceptional items and I think the progress will come next year but the jury is still out, said one, reflecting a general sentiment. They're spending a million pounds to reshape the business and it will be a long payback. Chief executive Lord Hollick said that a review of the group's businesses would be completed by the end of the year. This year's accounts will tell the full story, he said. Reviewing the merger, chairman Lord Stevens said in a statement One off costs will be significant and to date amount to . million pounds . United will take an million pound profit on the sale of specialist legal publisher Tolley in its full year figures. It is also seeking buyers for some local newspapers in southern England and Wales, a sale that could raise million pounds. On the debit side, it will take a charge in the second half of million pounds for the reorganisation of Express newspapers. It also faces costs of up to million pounds from its share in Britain's new Channel television station. The merger spawned an unlikely management team of Stevens and Hollick, dubbed The Odd Couple by the British press. Hollick, formerly MAI's managing director, is a staunch supporter of the opposition Labour Party, while Stevens' Express newspapers reflect his backing for the ruling Conservatives. United last week announced a plan to put the Daily and Sunday Express titles under a seven day editorial team in an attempt to halt a long term decline. Hollick said the newspapers had been starved of investment and vowed to plough million pounds back into Express annually in each of the next three years. . Pound
