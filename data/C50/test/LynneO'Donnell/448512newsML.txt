Far East metals traders said on Monday they were bearish about China's short term role in the world copper market, but conflicting signals from Chinese traders and industry officials added to prevailing confusion. Talk has been swirling through China's domestic markets since the middle of last week that copper traders on the Shanghai Metal Exchange SME had been told not to sell their red metal to prevent price falls. Trading sources in Shanghai told Reuters at the same time that an official directive along these lines had been issued after an industry seminar in Beijing. Shanghai copper futures opened higher on Monday on the reports, with local dealers saying the seminar had also resulted in a request that traders suspend imports and hold their own positions to prop up prices and help loss making state mines. The SME's most active June contract opened at , yuan , a tonne, up yuan, before advancing further to hit a peak of , yuan. An official of the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp CNIEC said no directives had been issued after the seminar to suspend copper imports or to order traders not to sell their copper to hold up prices. But the official said the firm, which is responsible for China's copper trade, had last week recommended traders hold their positions to wait for further price rises. This week he said the firm was urging traders to sell because prices were seen as favourable. China at the end of the day is a net importer of copper and if they are talking about stopping imports you've got to believe that there is enough available on the domestic market for the time being, a Singapore trader said. If they are halting imports, that can be nothing but bearish, he said. If they're not allowed to sell, that can be nothing but bearish. If this is indeed the case, the LME London Metal Exchange will come off, and you'll be sitting there with this huge arbitrage, which I cannot believe the Chinese traders will ignore, he said. Sources in Shanghai say warehouses in the city hold , tonnes of copper that would be available to the market. So there is no need to buy right now and if there is no buying imports then the Shanghai price will go up, said a local trader, adding he thought the SME price would hit , yuan per tonne in the short term. Western traders said that if Chinese buying does not soon start in earnest as has been expected since Chinese New Year in February and more so as the peak summer consumption period looms then LME copper price would tumble. China's imports of raw and uncast copper in were up . percent to , tonnes, official figures show. Exports were , tonnes, leaving net imports at , tonnes. China's copper mines are not believed to be losing money, as production costs in China are lower than in most places in the world, and current LME prices are almost twice Western production costs, trading sources said. Another source said the emphasis of China's copper imports had shifted from refined copper to concentrate so smelters can produce their own end product for the domestic market.
