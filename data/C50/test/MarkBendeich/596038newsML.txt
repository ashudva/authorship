Australian financial services group Colonial Ltd made a strong debut on the Australian share market on Monday, its share price soaring on listing. In early trading, Colonial shares opened at A . US . , well above the A . paid by institutional investors in the company's public share offer, which closed last Friday. The opening price eclipsed the A . paid by members of the public in the A million float, but those who took their stag profits and ran on Monday failed to dent the price.
