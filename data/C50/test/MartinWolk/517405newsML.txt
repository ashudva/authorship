Brown said Microsoft also realised solid gains from sales of operating systems. Microsoft makes the bulk of its money from platforms, including the operating systems preloaded onto new personal computers, which generate about one third of the company's revenues.

We haven't had very many quarters in which EPS earnings pr share went up percent, he said. That's not a quarter in, quarter out type of thing. This is just an incredible quarter.
