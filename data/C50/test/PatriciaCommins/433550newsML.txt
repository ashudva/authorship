Tony the Tiger is going global and he's adding chocolate flavored Frosted Flakes in the United States. Kellogg Co., the leading U.S. cereal maker, said Tuesday it will launch Frosted Flakes in the world's two most populous countries China and India and also in Thailand, starting this month. This will expand international marketing for Frosted Flakes, the top selling U.S. cereal backed by Kellogg's Tony the Tiger emblem. Frosted Flakes are already sold in markets such as Europe, Latin America, Australia and South Africa. Battle Creek, Mich. based Kellogg, which accounts for about one third of the billion U.S. cereal market, also said it will begin selling a chocolate flavored version of Frosted Flakes Cocoa Frosted Flakes in the United States next month. Cocoa Frosted Flakes are fat free and cholestrol free, the company said. Frosted Flakes is the industry's top selling cereal in the United States and ranks second worldwide behind Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Kellogg spokesman Anthony Hebron said. The new markets for Frosted Flakes reflect Kellogg's efforts to expand its international cereal business, which has been growing at a faster rate than its U.S. operations, analysts said. Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette analyst William Leach said he estimated Kellogg's international cereal sales grew by about percent in , a rate it is expected to match in .

Late last year, Kellogg launched Honey Crunch Corn Flakes, a new variety of its long standing Corn Flakes cereal. By late , Honey Crunch Corn Flakes held about a . percent market share, the company said. Internationally, nations like China, with a population of . billion, offer long term sales potential for Kellogg's. But Leach cautioned the Frosted Flakes launch will not have an immediate impact on Kellogg's earnings since there is not a widely established cereal market in some nations. Cereal is a breakfast habit that is not common to all humanity, Leach added. Starting Wednesday in China, Kellogg will introduce Tony's Flakes, a reference to Frosted Flakes' Tony the Tiger. The cereal will be launched in Thailand, which has a population of more than million, under the name Kellogg Corn Frosties on March , when a new plant is expected to be opened there. In India, with a population of nearly billion, the product will be introduced later this year as Kellogg's Frosties.

Battle Creek, Mich. based Kellogg also plans additional marketing support for Frosted Flakes in several countries outside the United States.
