British mutual insurer Norwich Union said on Thursday strong demand had led it to increase the members' offer in next week's flotation to . billion pounds billion . That means some million pounds worth of shares will be clawed back from the public offering, primarily financial institutions, to satisfy members' appetite for extra shares which saw many queuing to beat the June deadline.

For Norwich, the flotation will bring to an end more than years as a mutual with policyholders owning the company. Demutualisation will allow it to separate the group's life operations and thus policyholders' returns from the risks associated with its more volatile and cyclical general insurance business.

Nearly three million Norwich policyholders will share . billion free shares in addition to the extra discounted shares. Norwich still expects the offer price to range between pence and pence per share suggesting large profits for those lucky enough to get extra shares.
