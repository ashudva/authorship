People are beginning to realise that it's going to be a bleak quarter, said Jay Stevens, analyst at Dean Witter. But he continued to recommend accumulating IBM stock. Analysts said two main factors were hurting IBM's earnings prospects. Even though the world's largest computer maker will have a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding due to its share buyback plan, currency fluctuations and expected weakness in mainframe sales will hurt the first half of , they said. Morgan Stanley on Friday cut its earnings estimates for IBM, saying that the Armonk, N.Y. based company will make more money toward the end of the year instead of earlier. It also said results will be affected by currency fluctuations and the transition to a new mainframe model. Some users may wait for the new one, said Steve Milunovich, a Morgan Stanley analyst.

Analysts said IBM is expected to upgrade its low cost mainframes to a processor with speeds that match its older bi polar line that is being phased out. This is a major product transition, Stevens said. Analysts have been expecting initial shipments of the new processors in the third quarter. Milunovich said he expects a few models will be shipped in June. Merrill Lynch said on Thursday in a note to clients that it expects demand will be extremely good for the new machines and expects IBM to beat Wall Street's expectations of initial shipments in the third quarter.

But it expects percent revenue growth in the first quarter and a tough comparison vs. a year ago. Late Thursday, Dean Witter also lowered its earnings estimates for IBM, saying its operating income was expected to fall by percent in the first quarter. However, this is expected to be offset by a lower tax rate of percent vs. a previous percent, along with IBM's current stock repurchase plan, it said. Dean Witter raised its earnings estimate for the second half of the year and kept its profit estimate at . per share.
