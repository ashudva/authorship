Top seed Goran Ivanisevic cruised to a win over Romania's Adrian Voinea in the first round of the Czech Indoor Open on Monday. In the only other match involving a seeded player on the opening day, Britain's Tim Henman overpowered Sweden's Nicklas Kulti . Both players took advantage of the fast carpet court, blasting service winner after service winner to demoralise their opponents. Ivanisevic, ranked fifth in the world, started slowly against world number Voinea, before pulling away in the middle of the tie break and never looked back. It's always tough to play in a new hall and the carpet here is much faster than last week in Vienna, said Ivanisevic who hit aces. But this was good preparation though because the tournament has so many top players. To win it will take at least one win over a top player. Ivanisevic's is scheduled to play the winner of Tuesday's match between Czech Petr Korda and Ecuardor's Nicolas Lapentti and could also have to get past third seed Boris Becker and eighth seeded Czech Bohdan Ulihrach it he is to reach Sunday's final. Henman also used his dominating serve to wear down Kulti. It was a tough match but I think I should have taken the first set before the tiebreak, said Henman. He fought back well but I felt more comfortable in the second set. I enjoy playing a tough match right from the start, it focuses you very quickly.
