Embattled British property company Greycoat had the immediate threat of a shareholder call for its break up removed on Thursday, but the firm still faced an unwanted merger proposal from a smaller rival. Greycoat welcomed an overwhelming vote against the breakup resolution put forward by the UK Active Value Fund UKAV and chief executive Peter Thornton said he hoped the group could now get on with its normal business. It has cost us a lot of money and a lot of wasted effort and time. What we would like to do is get on with running a property company, Thornton said in an interview.

Moorfield has suggested demerging Greycoat's largest assets, but Thornton said it had yet to convince him it had proposals that would work. Moorfield shares were also unchanged at . pence, compared with a year high of pence and a low of pence.
