Bankruptcies in China unheard of for almost four decades are expected to more than double in number this year as authorities try to shed hopelessly indebted firms. The figure is expected to rise even further next year as officials become more determined not to subsidise loss making state firms. More than , Chinese companies were expected to go under in , up from , in or more than the previous six years put together, Cao Siyuan, architect of China's bankruptcy law, said. Whether enterprises are psychologically prepared for it or not, the rate of bankruptcies gradually increasing is unavoidable, Cao said in a recent interview. In the first half of this year, , enterprises declared bankruptcy, soaring by more than percent compared with the year ago period, said Cao, who now runs a consultancy to help enterprises seeking to merge or go bankrupt.
