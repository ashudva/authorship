Ancient tombs and temples were threatened by a dearth of government funds and official under reporting of those relics that warranted saving, according to the letter, a copy of which was made available to Reuters on Tuesday. The hearts of relic protection departments are like burning fire with , worries and misgivings, it said of the lack of funds. About historical sites, some of them dating to the Stone Age, could be flooded as soon as next year.
