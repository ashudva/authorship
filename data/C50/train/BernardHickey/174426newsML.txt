National Mutual Holdings Ltd managing director Geoff Tomlinson said on Thursday that strong investment markets meant group earnings for the year were likely to be in line with the July prospectus forecasts. It's been a very kind year. I can't think of when the markets have been more conducive to our type of business, Tomlinson told Reuters in an interview. He said he could not give a formal forecast of the profit result for the just completed year to September but an examination of the assumptions in National Mutual's share offer document would show the forecasts were likely to be met. You can go back and look at the investment assumptions in the share offer document and compare them with where we were at the end of September and we were in the fortunate position where most of the markets finished in line with predictions, he said. That would give you some underlying view that it's likely that our performance will be in line with that projection. National Mutual forecast in its offer document a consolidated net profit after tax of A million for the year ending September , up from A . million in . The assumptions underlying the forecast included an Australian day bill rate of . percent as at September , a year bond rate of . percent at September and a U.S. year bond rate of . percent as at September . The offer document, issued before National Mutual demutualised and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange last month, said its profit was not significantly sensitive to its stock market assumptions.
