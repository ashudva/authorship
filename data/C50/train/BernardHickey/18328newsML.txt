World yeast and spices giant Burns Philp amp Co Ltd announced a hefty loss for the year on Wednesday after taking some heavy hits in a vicious U.S. price war and Asian expansion. Burns Philp, the western world's largest fresh bakers' yeast maker and second largest spice maker, posted a net loss of A . million US . million for the year to June . This came after abnormal losses of A . million, due largely to rationalisation of its U.S. operations and other costs linked to a spice price war with the world's largest spice maker, McCormick amp Co Inc of the United States. Burns Philp managing director Ian Clack said the tussle for market share in the United States appeared to have abated, but the cost of paying supermarkets for premium shelf space during the two year war had to be written off. The writing off of these costs, known as slotting contracts, made up A . million of the abnormal losses. Recent slotting contracts have been negotiated with improved margins, indicating that market conditions are returning to a more acceptable level, Clack said. He said Burns Philp had increased its U.S. spices market share by one percentage point to percent after the war while McCormick's share had risen . points to percent. Other U.S. spice makers lost market share, he said. Burns Philp has percent of the western world's yeast market and seven percent of its spice market.

The result surprised brokers and analysts, who had expected large abnormal losses but were disappointed by a lower pre abnormals net profit as well. Net profit before abnormal items fell to A . million, down from the A . million posted in and down on most analysts' forecasts of about A million.

It was a bad result...the issue is whether or not they've completely taken the knife to intangible valuations, that's the area where there could be some further writedowns, one Sydney analyst said. They didn't take much off the intangibles. That the A . million of intangible writedowns hardly made a dent in it, another Sydney analyst said. Clack said the company had taken the most conservative measure of intangible values it could and did not expect any more abnormal losses in the current year. He said an earnings turnaround was possible in . In most markets we are seeing some improvement in the first two months of the year. There's been an improvement in demand, particularly in the North American markets. A U.S. cents
