Australia's largest home mortgage lender, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA , announced a surprisingly strong percent surge in first half profits on Wednesday, despite erosion of its interest margins. CBA said good cost control and a percent surge in business lending more than offset a further squeeze in home loan margins. Business volumes during the first half of were pleasing, leading to a better than expected interim result, CBA managing director David Murray told a news conference. This is likely to lead to a slightly better than expected full year result, Murray said. CBA's net profit for the six months to December rose to A million US million from A million in the comparable period a year earlier. CBA had itself been saying until now that it expected hot competition in its key home loan market would squeeze margins and keep profits flat in the year to June , . Analysts too had expected a subdued profit performance, forecasting a profit of between A million and A million. CBA's shares rallied sharply on the profit and on news of a interim dividend of cents per share, up seven cents on the previous interim dividend.

That cut triggered a round of mortgage rate cuts by the other major banks and was generally seen as the catalyst to a to basis point cut in big bank home loan margins. But CBA's pre emptive strike was also popular with home lenders, who increased their lending from the bank by percent in the half. Murray said the latest home loan cuts had more to do with increasingly aggressive competition in the home loan market than with any pre emption of another cut in official cash rates. Non bank lenders like Aussie Home Loans have snared about percent of the home loan market in the last three years with cheap loans funded by securitised bond issues. CBA also said its efforts to control costs and increase productivity were a factor in the better than expected profit. Meanwhile, CBA confirmed that it was looking closely at securitising some of its mortgage portfolio and that it was not looking at issuing a special dividend, contrary to speculation. A US .
