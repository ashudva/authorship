Analysts said on Wednesday they would increase their forecasts for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's CBA year net profit by about A million to A . billion after a surprisingly strong first half result. CBA posted a net profit for the six months to December of A million, up percent from A million in the previous comparable half and well above analysts' expectations of A million to A million. But analysts said the CBA's announcement of another round of unprompted mortgage rate cuts had dampened their enthusiasm. I'll have to push my numbers up a bit. It just depends on the effect of that rate cut today, said Macquarie Equities banking analyst Graham Maloney said. CBA announced that it would cut its main variable mortgage rate to . percent from . percent and would cut its 'no frills' Economiser variable rate to . percent from . percent from March for existing customers and February for new customers. The rate cut is seen ebbing further away at CBA's margins because of CBA managing director David Murray's comments that the cut was for competitive reasons, not in advance of another cut in official cash rates. ABN AMRO banking analyst Michael Pulman said he had increased his forecast for CBA's full year net profit post goodwill to about A . billion from about A . billion before the result. Pulman said the new rate cut would further cut margins, but that it may not be as much as in the past. Analysts said the increasing size of the CBA's commercial lending portfolio and its overseas portfolio meant the rate cut would have a proportionally lower effect. The competitive benefits and the resultingly stronger lending growth also dampened the effect of the cut on margins, they said. It's not huge at the end of the line, said Pulman. They said last year that for every basis point cut in the fully variable rate, you can cut A million from the profit immediately and A million over time, he said. I think it will be less than that this time. CBA's commercial lending approvals rose percent in the first half and new equipment finance rose percent. CBA said the launch of its Business Asset Finance and Capital Business Card products in July and October had attracted significant new business. Housing loans rose percent to A . billion in the first half and the CBA's share of total new home loan approvals continued to run ahead of its share of the total existing home loans. BNP Equities analyst Linda Lyon said she wouldn't be surprised if CBA's second half profit was actually lower than in the first half. There's this continual slicing into the margins, Lyon said. I would be looking at a flat second half, she said. Share traders however were much more ebullient, shunting CBA stock to a new all time high of A . in late afternoon trade, before it eased back to close . cents higher at A . . CBA's surge led the All Ordinaries index overall to a record closing high of , . , up . points. Sydney Newsroom
