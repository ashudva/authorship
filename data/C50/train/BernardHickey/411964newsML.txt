Transport equipment hire and logistics firm Brambles Industries Ltd said on Friday that it was on track to achieve current market expectations for a full year net profit of about A million. Brambles chief executive John Fletcher told Reuters in an interview that analysts should not extrapolate the stronger than expected first half profit growth into the full year. The message is that the existing market expectations for the full year that were there before this announcement, they're still looking O.K, Fletcher said. He said the average of the Barceps survey of analysts' forecasts for the year to June was A . million. This would be a near percent rise for the full year on the A . million pre abnormal net profit posted in . Earlier, Brambles reported its first half net profit rose . percent to A . million. There were no abnormals. Pre abnormal profit rose almost percent to A . million. But Brambles warned in its profit statement that it expected the rate of improvement evident in the first half to slow in the second half because of difficult trading conditions in Australia and Europe and a smaller boost from lower net interest costs. Fletcher said economic conditions in Australia remained subdued in the transport and logistics sectors and were likely to stay that way for the remainder of the year. Volumes are flat and the unions are looking for five to six percent per annum wage increases, he said. He said Brambles and others servicing the manufacturing sector, which was under intense price pressure from imports, were stuck between union demands for higher wages and the inability to pass higher costs in the form of higher prices. I don't think we're in a position to look for wage increases of four to five percent, he said.
