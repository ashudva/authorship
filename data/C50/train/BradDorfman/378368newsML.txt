Winthrop, with leased assets of million, specializes in leasing high technology and business equipment to companies throughout the United States, the company said. This is a well managed, dynamic firm that will increase our asset origination capacity and complement our existing lines of business, TCF Chief Executive Officer William Cooper said in a news release. Wintrhop, also based in Minneapolis, will become a subsidiary of TCF Bank Minnesota, the companies said. Winthrop's funding costs are expected to drop as a result, allowing it to grow its business.

The deal is likely to reduce earnings per share slightly in the first full year after the acquisition, and boost earnings after that, told analysts on a conference call. Minneapolis based TCF also said it has suspended its share repurchase program due to the accounting treatment it chose to use for the deal. The deal is expected to close by the third quarter, subject to negotiation of a definitive agreement, a due diligence review, and approval by both companies' boards of directors, shareholders and regulators. TCF, with assets of . billion, has banking operations in Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio. The proposed acquisition appears to fit Cooper's focus on power assets and power liabilites, said Joseph Duwan, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette amp Woods. The interest rate spreads are relatively wide, the yields are attractive, as opposed to straight commercial lending, Duwan said of the leasing business.
