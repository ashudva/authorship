Warm weather spurred sales of spring merchandise and boosted retail sales in February, the nation's store chains said Thursday, but flooding in the Midwest could hurt results in March. Industry officials and analysts said most winter clothing was cleared out of stores in January and early February, so retailers were properly stocked for spring. Salomon Bros. said its index of same store sales rose . percent in February, compared to a . percent rise a year ago and a . percent January rise. Same store sales measure results at stores open at least a year. It looks like early trends on spring fashion are good, said Harry Ikenson, analyst at Rodman amp Renshaw Inc. Inventories seem to be in good shape and it's a good start to spring. After January's sales performance, our level of clearance merchandise coming into February was substantially below last year, said William Kellogg, chairman of Kohl's Corp., a Wisconsin based retailer with stores in the Midwest and the East. We are particularly encouraged by the early selling of spring merchandise. Though comparisons were difficult after retailers posted a strong February in , a week of temperatures in the s and s in much of the country this year was a plus. It drives people in to buy spring merchandise, analyst Peter Schaeffer at Dillon Read amp Co. said. Several chains posted stronger than expected results. Wal Mart Stores Inc., the nation's larget retailer, said same store sales rose . percent, above analysts' forecasts, while J.C. Penney Co. Inc. posted a strong . percent gain. Kmart Corp., the third biggest retailer, said sales rose . percent at comparable stores, while Sears, Roebuck and Co., the No. retailer, posted a . percent gain.

I was particularly pleased with the strong initial sell through on new spring receipts during the month, Carson Chief Executive Stanton Bluestone said in a statement. Sales at clothing chain The Gap Inc. were flat. Sales of computers and other electronic gear continued to lag, though results were not as weak as had been expected. Electronics superstores Best Buy Co. Inc. and Circuit City Stores said sales fell percent and percent, respectively. Analysts had expected sales declines of up to percent. Sales of electronic gear, which have been dismal for several months, were unlikely to improve until later this year or early when new high tech products are due to be available, analysts said. They also said retail stocks were unlikely to be as strong as they were in . I don't think that we're seeing any sort of a rally here in retail like we saw last year, Dillon Read's Schaeffer said. I don't think it's a sector play, it's an individual stock play. Gap shares fell . to . , Dillard fell cents to . , Sears lost cents to . , and Federated was unchanged at . .
