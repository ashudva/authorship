Under a definitive agreement, U.S. Bancorp shareholders will receive in a tax free exchange . share of First Bank common stock for each U.S. Bancorp share they own. Based on First Bank's trading price of . Thursday, which was down . , the purchase price equals . a share for holders of U.S. Bancorp, whose shares jumped . to . This is very rich pricing, said James Schutz at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp., noting the deal values U.S. Bancorp at about . times its earnings. However, First Bank Chief Executive John Grundhofer's reputation for aggressive cost cutting, the complementary fit of U.S. Bancorp with First Bank's mostly Midwestern markets and the rich price of bank stocks in general made the deal palatable to many analysts. You could live a couple of lifetimes without finding another fit this good, Grundhofer said in a statement announcing the deal. It's a natural fit for them, said Frank Barkocy, analyst at Josephthal, Lyon amp Ross. It's a natural extension of their marketplace.

Grundhofer will be president and chief executive of the new company, which will take the U.S. Bancorp name but remain based in Minneapolis. U.S. Bancorp Chairman Gerry Cameron will serve as chairman of the merged bank until his retirement in . Since , First Bank has made acquisitions, including the million acquisition of Nebraska based FirsTier Financial Inc. in . Cameron said he was first approached by Grundhofer about a deal in early November. I frankly told him he should go talk to someone else that was interested, Cameron told reporters during a conference call. But he said he felt a responsibility to shareholders to hear Grundhofer out and the two discussed the deal around Thanskgiving. After subsequent meetings and a review that ended last weekend, both sides were even more convinced the deal made sense, he said.
