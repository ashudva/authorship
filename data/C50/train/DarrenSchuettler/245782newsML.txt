Ontario Hydro, North America's biggest power utility, said Tuesday that it would take a huge C . billion . billion charge in to strengthen its financial structure. The debt laden, Ontario government owned utility said its board of directors also approved a C million million charge against earnings. The charges, related to accounting and operational changes, come as the ruling Conservative government of Canada's most populous province ponders the privatisation of the massive utility. The heavy writedowns add up to an estimated net loss of C . billion . billion , Ontario Hydro said in a statement. The utility previously forecast net income of between C million million and C million million . These decisions are driven by our determination to improve nuclear performance and to make capital and policy decisions that enable us to succeed in the business environment we face, said Ontario Hydro Chief Executive Officer Allan Kupcis. He said the move will not affect Hydro's ability to pay down its debt, estimated at more than C billion billion due to overexpansion. Ontario Hydro is the continent's largest electricity producer based on installed generating capacity and one of the world's biggest non sovereign borrowers. It operates hydro electric stations, five nuclear plants and six fossil fuel stations. But competitive pressures from within and outside Ontario have forced changes on Hydro in recent years. Last June, a government commission recommended that Ontario Hydro lose its year power monopoly and face competition from private Canadian power suppliers and U.S. based competitors. Among the operating decisions made Tuesday, the utility said it will scale back or cancel some projects. The biggest single charge was a C . billion million writedown reflecting the costs of surplus heavy water at its nuclear operations. The decisions will not affect employee staffing levels at the utility.
