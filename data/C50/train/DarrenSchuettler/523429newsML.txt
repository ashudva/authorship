About half od the tax reduction has been implemented, with the remaining percent due by . The province's improving finances has led to speculation that Eves may accelerate the timing of remaining tax cuts. Usually where there is smoke there is fire and they the government have certainly been quite forward talking about that possibility. It wouldn't be a big surprise if they did accelerate it, Porter said. Wright said the government's negotiations with Ontario's municipalities on the funding of services may prevent a speedier tax cut.
