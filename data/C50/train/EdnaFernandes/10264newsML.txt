Imperial Tobacco Group will split from conglomerate Hanson Plc on October as one of the most efficient players in its sector, but while the new chief talks of export led growth, the outlook is clouded by the threat of litigation against tobacco firms. Imperial is Britain's second biggest tobacco firm after B.A.T Industries and its brands include Embassy, John Player Special and Superkings cigarettes as well as Panama and Castella cigars. It is one of four arms of the mighty Hanson conglomerate being spun off into separate floated companies to unlock value. In the ten years since Hanson took over Imperial, it has slashed costs, cut its brands to from and raised productivity by percent. profits were million pounds on . billion of sales. But analysts fear that despite Imperial's impressive track record, marking it as the comeback kid of the tobbaco industry, its shares could face a rough ride once listed in London. This week saw tobacco stocks hit by a backlash in the United States, with fresh litigation plus tough new curbs from U.S. President Bill Clinton to regulate the industry. So far, BAT Industries has borne the brunt. But some analysts believe it is only a matter of time before the U.S. scenario widens its impact and is repeated across the Atlantic. If it happens in the U.S. it's subsequently followed in other countries, said Zafar Khan, analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. Imperial could have been a ripe international takeover candidate. But the litigation threat means a group buying a tobacco company would have a tough time selling the idea to shareholders now, he said. UBS analysts agree that the threat of legal action is enough to dampen the company's outlook.

Hanson shares were down pence at by GMT Friday. UBS specifically values the Imperial constituent at pence per share or . billion pounds . billion . However, another investment analyst who declined to be named, said he was more upbeat on Imperial's prospects. It's a clean business. It could become a takeover target and it's also very cash generative, he said. He values Imperial at pence in a total Hanson break up valuation of pence per share. There is some upside to the Imperial story. Apart from being viewed as a highly efficient player and being the second biggest UK tobacco company with percent of the market, it is also poised to try and tap the vast emerging markets. Gareth Davis corrects from Nigel Davis , Imperial's chief executive who joined the company straight from university, told the London based Evening Standard newspaper earlier this week that he believed the group would continue to build up exports to Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Worldwide this industry is buoyant, he said. Imperial has said in earlier mission statements that it will expand abroad through organic growth and acquisition.
