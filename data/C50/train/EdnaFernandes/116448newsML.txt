Two of the biggest names in the British motor industry, Rover and Vauxhall, kicked off the British International Motor Show on Tuesday by unveiling big new investments to fuel their drive for more exports. Rover, owned by Germany's BMW, said it planned to launch a new four wheel drive baby Land Rover to take on Japanese rivals in Britain and world export markets. The new vehicle, due to go on sale in , is part of Rover's rolling . billion pound . billion investment programme. Rover will in addition inject . billion pounds of new business into the components industry. This will go mainly to British firms and safeguard tens of thousands of jobs at Rover and its supplier firms. Vauxhall, owned by General Motors of the United States.S., also guaranteed , existing jobs at its Ellesmere Port complex in northwest England with the announcement of a million pound investment to modernise the plant.

The Birmingham based motor show, following the recent Paris showcase, saw motor companies banging the sales drum, seeking to gloss over their problems with glitz and new gizmos to tempt customers into buying. But exports remain key. Rover's new chief executive, Dr Walter Hasselkus, said The baby Land Rover is very much an export product, adding that he hoped its export sales would account for percent of production and boost sales in .
