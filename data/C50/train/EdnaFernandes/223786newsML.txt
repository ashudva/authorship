Stagecoach Plc, the bus to rail operator which has seen its shareprice double in under a year, said on Thursday it expected ongoing progress in dividend growth after reporting record profits of million stg. Keith Cochrane, finance director, told Reuters We expect ongoing progress in our second half dividend, even after raising the interim payout by percent to three pence. But he pointed out that the first dividend reflected the million stg profit from the sale of its stake in Strathclyde Buses.
