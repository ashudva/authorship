British entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Group said on Friday it had clinched the CrossCountry passenger rail franchise and planned to spend an extra million pounds million on new trains and increased services. CrossCountry, which covers more than stations and is based in the central British city of Birmingham, is one of the last few passenger rail franchises to be awarded under Britain's rail priavatisation programme. The company has staff and in the year to March passenger revenues were million pounds. Our key plan is to buy a new fleet, spending million on new rolling stock, agreed as part of the bid, Will Whitehorn, director of Virgin Rail, said in an interview.
