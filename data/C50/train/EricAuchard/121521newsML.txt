Intel Corp stock surged on Tuesday, lifted by a quarterly earnings report that substantially outpaced Wall Street expectations and confirmed its status among analysts as the shooting star of technology stocks.

Every Intel processor that goes into a PC is accompanied by serveral such ancillary chips. Intel is the locomotive who drags along all the other guys in this food chain, Westmont said. As a result, these other guys are enjoying higher recognition today.
