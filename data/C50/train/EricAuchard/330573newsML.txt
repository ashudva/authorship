Cascade Communications Corp said its core frame relay business continued to grow in at the hyper growth rates seen in recent years, but that some of the evidence of this was concealed in its other businesses. In a phone interview, chief executive Daniel Smith said some frame relay business is now concealed in sales of Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM products, a newer line of high speed data transmission products Cascade sells. Smith also said he sees Cascade gaining frame relay market share in , but at perhaps a slower pace than to date. We grew market share significantly in and we expect to continue that in , but maybe at a slower rate than in , he told Reuters. He declined to quantify these growth goals saying it was company policy not to make such forecasts.

By late afternoon Friday, Cascade stock had fallen to on volume of nearly million shares. Fourth quarter net income was . per share, a penny ahead of consensus, versus . in the fourth quarter.
