Overseas subsidiaries of Japan's top brokerage, Nomura Securities Co Ltd, virtually doubled their combined profits in the half year to September, energised by strong earnings in Europe. An official of Nomura told Reuters its subsidiaries abroad made a total of . billion yen million in pre tax profit in the six months, the first half of Japan's fiscal year, almost double the approximately nine billion yen . million in the same period a year earlier.
