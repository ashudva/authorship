Embattled Nomura Securities Co Ltd is expected to announce on Thursday the best results among more than brokerages in Japan for the last business year, but prospects for the current year are gloomy. Analysts said on Monday that Nomura's profits for the fiscal year which ended on March should be far ahead of its competitors thanks to huge profits in bond trading and bond underwriting. However, they added that business for Nomura in the year would be sharply undermined by a scandal, with the size of the expected profit drop depending on how hard the Finance Ministry comes down on Japan's largest brokerage after regulators complete their investigation. Japanese prosecutors and securities watchdog are investigating Nomura for suspected illegal deals involving sokaiya racketeers, who extort money from a company by threatening to disturb shareholders' meetings.

Nomura's share of trading volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to . percent in March from . percent in February, toppling it from the top spot it has held since February . If Nomura's market share falls by percent, it will lose billion yen million in commissions, analysts said. In addition, Nomura's underwriting business has also been hit by the scandal. The business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported last week that Nomura had underwritten only . percent of the domestic straight bonds issued so far in April, compared with percent for all of the previous business year. Three other big brokerages Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, Nikko Securities Co Ltd T and Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd are also scheduled to announce their results later this month.
