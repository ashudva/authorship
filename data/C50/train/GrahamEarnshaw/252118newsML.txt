China's B shares fell once again on Thursday with investors running scared in the face of reports that securities authorities would restrict mainland Chinese from trading in B shares, traders said. Shanghai's foreign currency B share index closed down . points or . percent to . points while Shenzhen's B index fell . points, or . percent, to . . Securities authorities in Shenzhen have contacted brokerages in the city, located across the border from Hong Kong, telling them to not accept money from domestic investors for stock purchases unless they had proof the money came from abroad, traders said. An influx of funds from local investors has been at the heart of the spectacular rise in B shares over the past month, and fears that the tap would be turned off is making investors re assess their positions, analysts said. Chinese authorities have in the past expressed concern at domestic investors buying B shares, which were intended for foreign investors, saying it left locals vulnerable to the inflows and outflows of foreign money. Shanghai stocks reacted on Thursday to the Shenzhen reports, but analysts said Shanghai securities authorities had so far not issued the same warning to the city's brokerages. The Shenzhen crackdown has triggered fears it will spread to Shanghai, said a trader. Sentiment has been badly hurt. We have not heard of any crackdown in Shanghai. There is no indication of a crackdown here, said one foreign broker. The broker said other factors in the Shanghai B market's fall were profit taking and the issue of new Shanghai Diesel Engine Co Ltd B shares, which started trading today at a lower price than the company's existing shares. He said the three largest brokerages in Shenzhen were believed to have stopped opening B share accounts for Chinese nationals. But large punters have ways to circumvent these regulations and have capital offshore, he said, adding that many retail investors could also easily call relatives abroad or in Hong Kong to arrange transfers. The CSRC China Securities Regulatory Commission is going for one weak link in the trading arrangements... the flow of funds, said Bruce Richardson, chief representative of HG Asia in Shanghai.
