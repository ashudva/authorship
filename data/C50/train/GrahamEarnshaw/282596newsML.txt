China's domestic A share markets will rise strongly in due to the improving national economy but the pyrotechnics of will not be repeated with Beijing insisting on steady development, analysts said on Tuesday. The official crackdown two weeks ago on rampant share speculation has made the markets much more wary, but there is still plenty of money in China looking to get into the country's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, they said.
