Our profit, according to international accounting standards, is roughly percent lower than in the same period of the last year. But there are very important methodological influences, Ziegler told reporters.

He said fourth quarter results could be affected by unclear development on the stock market and other factors. Sandy Winthrop Chen, vice president of equity research at the Prague office of CS First Boston, welcomed the figures, The results are quite in line with our expectations, I think the performance is very strong, and it puts Komercni Banka in a very good position to meet or exceed out forecast.

Komercni share price jumped crowns on the Prague Stock Exchange soon after the news to , , and closed at , after a week of heavy losses in which some analysts anticipated poor results. Dealer Karel Ruzicka of ING Barings said the results were in line with his expectations and partly attributed Komercni's share price rise to demand from foreign investors. Some of the foreign investors...think they are not so bad therefore we can see some demand in the stock, he said. Added Chen We definitely remain buyers of the stock, and the recent weakeness in the shareprice we interpret as a major buyer opportunity. Komercni's largest shareholder is still the Czech government which has a . percent stake, followed by the Bank of New York which has accumlated a . percent stake. Prague Newsroom,
