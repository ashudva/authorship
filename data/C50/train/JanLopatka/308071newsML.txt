Parliament approved a fifth straight balanced budget plan in December, with both expenditures and revenues forecast at . billion crowns in . But the budget was based on economic growth of . percent, and many independent analysts have forecast growth for this year at under five percent, after growth between . and . percent for the whole of . Many have voiced concern that slower than expected economic growth might force the government to consider major changes in the budget to keep a much larger deficit at bay. Prague Newsroom,
