However, investment funds, which have so far failed to attract investors and exist on only a tiny scale, could become a target for private funds in , the China Daily Business Weekly said on Sunday. Investment in housing and insurance could become alternatives this year after small investors burnt their fingers in the stock markets and in corporate bonds and failed to buy state debt due to enormous competition, it said. Stamps, coins, antiques and art targets of the destructive fervour of Red Guards in the radical Cultural Revolution would continue to play an important role in the portfolios of families with money to save, it said.

He ruled out a substantial drop in personal bank deposits as a result of the lower interest rates and saw little likelihood of a flood of consumer spending. Bank savings would remain the first choice for individuals in , ahead of stocks and bonds, Zhao said. Officials were eager to lure deposits into China's state owned banks, saddled with huge bad debts from state owned enterprises and still required to help out state firms identified as strategic by the central government.
