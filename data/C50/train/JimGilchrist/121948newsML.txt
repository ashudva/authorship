Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said it has retired the last of its Lockheed TriStars. Cathay's TriStar airliners in the carrier's old green and white livery have been a familiar sight in the Hong Kong skies since flying more than , hours and millions of passengers. At its peak the fleet was logging , kilometres every week equal to the moon and halfway back. It is more than a piece of metal. The TriStar has got character and it's a bit of a thoroughbred, said veteran Cathay pilot Captain John Bent. The three engined L airliners have been gradually phased out over the past two years and replaced in a US billion fleet replacement programme on Cathay's regional and medium haul routes by new, twin engined Airbus Industrie A and Boeing airliners offering greater fuel efficiency, passenger comfort and cargo handling capability. The A can carry up to LD cargo containers in its belly weighing up to tons, the TriStar can only carry around eight tons of cargo, Cathay said. The airline says many of its TriStar fleet, which have been renowned for reliability and as a pilot's favourite, have been sold to other airlines to continue faithful service in the USA and Europe.
