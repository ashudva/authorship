British Airways World Cargo BAWC is to employ a fourth weekly freighter between Hong Kong and London from next year, BAWC's regional cargo manager Pacific, Chris Humphrey said. We will definitely be moving forward with a fourth freighter. We are very bullish about the prospects for Hong Kong and Chinese economic growth. There's definitely a growing market here and next year's handover from a cargo point of view is immaterial. Other concerns such as US Chinese trade relations have a much greater impact, Humphrey told Reuters in an interview at the British flag carrier's Hong Kong regional headquarters. British Airways currently flies three Boeing freighters a week between Hong Kong and London Gatwick which are wet leased from Atlas Air Inc. Denver based Atlas uses converted passenger 's to fly for several major airlines on aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance ACMI long term, wet lease contracts which BA says it is happy to continue because no capital costs are incurred. The cargo executive said statistics proved how strong the Hong Kong market is for BAWC. Humphrey said statistics of all Association of European Airlines AEA carriers in the Asia Pacific Region showed BAWC enjoyed an . percent increase in market share between January and July measured by Freight Tonne Kilometres FTK . The traffic average for AEA carriers, which included Air France and Swissair, both to and from the region was . per cent, he said.
