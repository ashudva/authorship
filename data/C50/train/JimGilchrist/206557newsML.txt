Engineers are investigating the cause of an engine failure aboard a Cathay Pacific Airways Limited airliner on November which forced return to Ho Chi Minh City on one engine, an airline spokesman said commenting on a report in Flight International. The Airbus A and passengers had reached , feet after take off when one of its two Rolls Royce engines suffered a suspected gearbox failure. The pilots could not restart the powerplant and decided to return to Ho Chi Minh City where the engine was removed and flown back to Hong Kong for a detailed inspection, the spokesman stated. The suspect gearbox part has since been returned to the U.K. for detailed analysis, a Rolls Royce spokesman in Hong Kong said. Cathay has a fleet of nine Airbus A s which seat around passengers and carry up to tonnes of belly cargo on inter Asian routes. A spokeswoman for Hong Kong Dragon Airlines known as Dragonair, in which Cathay holds a minority stake, operates R R powered A s. R R is a long term supplier to Cathay and since the Trent engine entered service with Cathay in February , this is the second recorded inflight shutdown, the Cathay spokesman said. Industry observers say aircraft engines are now so reliable that mechanical failures are extremely rare. Intense rivalry for new engines, particularly for the next generation of the Boeing family, exists between R R and its U.S. competitors Pratt amp Whitney and General Electric s, the industry sources said.
