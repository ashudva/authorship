Cathay Pacific Airways has raised air cargo rates from Hong Kong to compensate for higher fuel costs, cargo marketing and sales manager Ray Jewell told Reuters. He declined to say by how much rates have been increased but said they have been introduced on a route by route basis wherever possible and not system wide. There's been a huge cost associated with the increase in fuel and we have already had to make adjustments in our rates to compensate, Jewell said. Other major airlines told Reuters they are raising their ex Hong Kong cargo rates in response to higher fuel costs after an attempt to impose an Hong Kong cents a kilo fuel surcharge was turned down by the territory's Civil Aviation Department. The HK cents surcharge is the equivalent to the U.S cents kg fuel surcharge being levies by many airlines around the world. Cathay is currently applying this surcharge or the local currency equivalent to flights from Europe. Cathay Cargo also reported very good peak season business both in and out of Hong Kong on long haul routes which shows no sign of any slackening off. Flights are full now and it is a very good peak season, Jewell said. Earlier Cathay had said it would soon apply to the CAD for a three percent increase in passenger fares because of higher fuel costs. Air Cargo Newsroom Tel Fax
