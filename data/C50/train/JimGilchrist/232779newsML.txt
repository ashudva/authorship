Singapore Airlines Ltd SIA has taken delivery of a new Boeing freighter, an airline spokesman has told Reuters. The new arrival brings SIA's cargo fleet to five and one freighter which is expected to be replaced by a sixth in March next year, the spokesman added. SIA's latest freighter flew into Singapore's Changi airport on November and is due to make its first revenue earning flight to San Francisco and Los Angeles at a date yet to be announced. It will then be used on all SIA's cargo routes worldwide, the spokesman added. Air Cargo Newsroom Tel Fax
