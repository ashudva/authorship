Thames Water reported a strong rise in profits and dividend on Tuesday to kick off Britain's water utility half year results season, perking up shares in the sector with hopes others would be as generous to shareholders. Thames said first half pre tax profits rose to million pounds million after exceptional items from . million pounds in the same period last year while profits before exceptionals were up percent to million pounds. The one off items included a . million pound cost on the premium of repurchasing convertible bonds alongside its buyback of percent of its shares over the summer. Thames hiked its dividend by percent to . pence. The figures are quite reassuring, the dividend is probably the major feature, said David Campbell of broker Greig Middleton. Thames managing director Bill Alexander told Reuters he expected to maintain the dividend at this sort of level, pointing out that the half year increase included a rise of some percent taking account of the buyback. They are indicating the rate of dividend increase will be like this for the full year, Campbell said. Thames shares were up four pence to pence by GMT, off a high of pence. Among other privatised water companies due to report in the coming weeks, Severn Trent was up eight pence to pence and Yorkshire Water gained six pence to pence. Thames also said it would make extra investment of million pounds in services, which Alexander said would be targeted at reducing leakage of water, at sewerage systems, an extension to the London ring main supply and a new reservoir. Leakage, which has been a hot political issue for the privatised water firms, was down percent from year ago levels, Alexander said. Thames will focus on core water and sewerage activities, it said, but still managed to turn round its activities outside the regulated British water sector to a nine million pound profit at the half year from three million pounds loss a year ago. People will be pleased we got nine million pounds from the non core for the first time...but our primary concern is the core and getting that right, Alexander said. The non core businesses cover international contracts, services such as waste management, and property and insurance. Thames said in a statement i There is a little confusion as to where all that's going, Campbell said. Thames said that operating margins rose to . percent in the first half, up . percent on the same time last year, while gearing was up to percent from percent. Alexander said the company was looking at broadening cooperation with local electricity supplier London Electricity but said a merger between the two was still not on the cards.
