British water and sewerage company South West Water turned in sparkling first half profits on Thursday and hiked its dividend by an expected percent, promising further increases in years to come. The company, which evaded takeover earlier this year when two proposed bids were blocked by the UK government, said it expected to raise its total dividend by percent this year and make real a rise of eight percent for the foreseeable future . South West Water's pretax profits for the six months ending September rose to . million pounds . million up percent and ahead of expectations of to million pounds. It paid out a dividend of . pence as promised when the bids, from Severn Trent and Wessex, were unexpectedly halted by the UK government in October. The dividend policy will continue to be based on the pursuit of progressive growth, the company said in a statement. But the half year surge in profits was unlikely to be repeated, finance director Ken Hill told Reuters. I do not think a percent increase in PBT profit before tax is likely to occur at the end of this year, he said, nor in years immediately following. But we are looking for profit increases, he added.

It has since made an earlier rebate of pounds to customers, announced additional investment of million pounds and brought forward million pounds of investment in cleaning up at Newquay, a favourite beach area for surfers. Hill said the company's strategy now was to focus on the core business...and develop very carefully the strategy of the non regulated businesses. Dividend payouts would be helped by efficiency savings and improved profitability in its non regulated businesses, which contributed . million pounds to interim profits, executives told a press conference. Chairman Keith Court told journalists the company aimed to balance turnover contributions of non regulated and regulated businesses as soon as we can. New acquisitions contributed around . million pounds to operating profits of some . million pounds in non regulated business this year and Hill said there was between and million pounds available to make further purchases. But there are no specific plans for acquisitions. Our track record shows...we are not frightened of making acquisitions but it is a question of finding ones that make sense, Colin Drummond, head of the group's non core division, said. At the same time, the company's balance sheet was strong enough to effect a share buyback if it decided to make use of a mandate to buy percent of shares, Hill said. . Pound
