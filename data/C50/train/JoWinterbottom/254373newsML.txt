The remaining independent British regional electricity companies Recs could become fair game for predators as the British government approved on Friday a hostile bid for Northern Electric from U.S. based CE Electric. Shares in the only three remaining Recs which are not currently subject to bids Southern, London and Yorkshire gained strongly as the market speculated further offers would emerge. The government cleared CE Electric's pence per share bid earlier on Friday with some conditions aimed at clearing up financial queries, lifting a cloud of uncertainty which had kept Northern's shares languishing around pence. This is the green light for other bids to emerge, said Fraser McLaren, analyst at Greig Middleton. Northern shares closed p higher at p after peaking at pence and analysts said the million pound . billion bid from CE, which is percent owned by CalEnergy, was likely to be successful. London rose pence to and Southern gained pence to with Yorkshire putting on pence to . East Midlands Electricity, which has agreed to a . billion takeover by Dominion Resources of the U.S. at pence per share, strode pence higher to as the market assumed approval for this less contentious bid. Seven of the original cash rich Recs have fallen to predators since they came up for grabs in March when the government's protective golden share expired, five years after privatisation in . Three of these South Western, Seeboard and Midlands have already been sold to U.S. companies and American firms are hotly tipped to be potential buyers of other Recs as they are attracted by easier regulation and expertise in supply. The regulator has acknowledged there is not a problem in terms of loss of yardsticks by virtue of it being an outside takeover, said McLaren, adding that a takeover from inside the industry might still find obstacles. Of the three remaining Recs, London and Yorkshire are considered the most likely takeover targets as they are smaller and less expensive to swallow than Southern, which analysts said could carry a price tag of over two billion pounds. Southern, which had an agreed takeover by generator National Power blocked by the government and then failed to win a bid battle for Southern Water with Scottish Power, appears to be aiming to stay independent. It has a strong balance sheet and could mount a hefty defence against any hostile advance, they added. Southern has formidable firepower and so any bid would probably have to be agreed and could be a joint effort by two companies, said Nigel Hawkins of Yamaichi. London and Yorkshire would cost a predator up to around . billion pounds each, analysts added, at levels of above pence and pence per share respectively. That's a price which could be contemplated by a company if it were to want a foothold in the UK supply market, said one analyst who asked not to be named. London has already had discussions with U.S. group Entergy, which called off talks in November but said it still considered Britain an attractive market.
