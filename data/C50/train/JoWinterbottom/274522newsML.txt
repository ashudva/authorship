Northern Electric Plc Tuesday lost its bitterly fought battle to stay independent, finally falling victim to a million British pound . billion hostile bid from Omaha, Neb. based CalEnergy Co. Inc. CalEnergy's CE Electric won control of the privatised British regional electricity company with a wafer thin majority, gaining the support of only . percent of shareholder votes. The margin was a mere , shares. The bid was so closely fought it ran over its original deadline, and the outcome was in doubt right down to the wire. Insurer Prudential Corp. stepped in at the th hour to try to thwart CE's efforts by buying up nearly million Northern shares from investors who had previously accepted CE's bid. CE Electric Chairman David Sokol said, We look forward to working with Northern Electric's management to put in place a smooth transition. We are delighted by the outcome of the final offers for Northern Electric's shareholders, he said in a statement. Northern said it would not make an immediate statement. We will give a recommendation to shareholders after Christmas, a Northern spokesman said. CalEnergy stock rose . cents to . in abbreviated trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Last Friday's original bid deadline was extended to a.m. EST Tuesday after CE protested about stock purchases by Northern's advisers, merchant bank Schroders and Barclays Plc's BZW, and a , pound , fee to BZW not disclosed until Friday. On Monday, an appeal by Northern to reverse the deadline extension was rejected by Britian's Takeover Panel, which polices mergers and acquisitions in London's financial district. Analysts said the takeover battle will leave a number of questions to be answered over the role of advisers. The bid was the second hostile takeover that Northern had faced it spent million pounds billion fending off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner. Northern, the first privatised power company to become a takeover target, initially received a billion pound . billion bid from Trafalgar House at the end of . But the offer was scuttled when an industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, announced plans for more stringent price controls, sending electricity stock prices tumbling. Northern's demise was the th takeover of one of the cash rich regional electric companies that were privatised in and became available when the government's golden share expired in March . It is also the fourth to be taken over by an American company. Two more bids by Richmond, Va. based Dominion Resources Inc. for East Midlands Electricity and by Entergy Corp. of New Orleans for London Electricity are under way. American companies are heavily favoured as the most likely buyers for the remaining regional electric companies as they find the British regulatory environment more relaxed and see them as a useful springboard for expansion into Europe. Among potential bidders, analysts named Houston Industries Inc., which failed in its attempt to secure control of Norweb with Central amp South West Corp. in October . Florida Power amp Light Co. and Pacific Gas amp Electric Co., which have both been rumoured previously to be interested in regional electricity companies, are again being eyed as possible buyers. Entergy has just clinched an agreed . billion pound . billion deal to take over London Electricity, which provides power to the capital and its financial heart, the City. The electricity companies have attracted harsh criticism from lobbying groups and the British media over fat executive pay packages, shareholder payouts and spiraling takeover prices.
