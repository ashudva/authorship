British regional electricity company REC Northern Electric Plc on Tuesday lost a bitter battle to stay independent, finally falling to a million pound . billion bid from U.S. utility CalEnergy Co Inc. CalEnergy's CE Electric won control with a wafer thin majority, gaining the support of . percent of the votes, a margin of just , shares. The bid was so closely fought that it ran over its original deadline and the outcome was uncertain right down to the wire. Insurer Prudential Corp stepped in at the eleventh hour to try to thwart CE's move by buying up nearly one million Northern shares from investors who had previously accepted CE's bid. We look forward to working with Northern Electric's management to put in place a smooth transition, CE Electric's chairman and chief executive David Sokol said in a statement. Northern said it would not make an immediate statement. We will give a recommendation to shareholders after Christmas, a Northern spokesman said. Last Friday's original bid deadline was extended to GMT on Tuesday after CE protested about share purchases by Northern's advisers Schroders and BZW and a , pound fee to BZW not disclosed until Friday. On Monday an appeal by Northern to reverse the deadline extension was rejected by the Takeover Panel, which polices mergers and acquisitions in the City of London. Analysts said the takeover battle would leave a number of questions to be answered over the role of advisers. The bid was the second hostile takeover that Northern had faced it spent million pounds fending off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner. Northern, which was then the first privatised British power company to become a takeover target, initially received a billion pound bid from Trafalgar House at the end of . But the offer was scuppered when electricity industry regulator Stephen Littlechild announced plans for more stringent price controls, sending electricity share prices tumbling. Northern's fall marks the tenth of the cash rich RECS privatised in to be taken over since they became available when the government's golden share expired in March . It is also the fourth to be taken over by a U.S. company with two further agreed bids from U.S. firms Dominion Resources and Entergy for East Midlands and London Electricity, respectively, currently under way. American companies are hotly tipped as the most likely buyers for the remaining RECs as they find the British regulatory environment more relaxed and see them as a useful springboard for expansion into Europe. Among potential bidders, analysts named Houston Industries, which failed in its attempt to secure control of Norweb with Central amp South West Corp in October . Florida Power amp Light and Pacific Gas amp Electric, which have both been rumoured previously to be interested in RECS, are again being eyed as possible buyers. Entergy of the U.S. has just clinched an agreed . billion pound deal to take over London Electricity, which provides power to the capital and its financial heart, the City. The electricity companies have attracted harsh criticism from lobby groups and the British media over fat executive pay packets, shareholder payouts and spiralling takeover prices. . Pound
