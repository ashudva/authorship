The deal, announced simultaneously in Paris and London, brings the company back from the brink of insolvency but leaves shareholders owning only . percent of the company. The restructuring plan provides Eurotunnel with the medium term financial stability to allow it to consolidate its substantial commercial achievements to date and to develop its operations, Eurotunnel co chairman Alastair Morton said.

This was extended to the instructing banks at a meeting late last week in London. Eurotunnel said the debt for equity swap would be at pence, or . francs, per share. That is considerably below the level of around pence widely reported before announcement of the deal, and will reduce outstanding debt of . billion pounds . billion by . billion . billion . The company said a further . billion pounds . billion of debt would be converted into new financial instruments and existing shareholders would be able to participate in this issue. If they choose not to take up free warrants entitling them to subscribe to this, Eurotunnel said shareholders' interests may be reduced further to just over percent of the company by the end of December . Eurotunnel's shares, which were suspended last week at . pence ahead of Monday's announcement, should resume trading on Tuesday, the company said.
