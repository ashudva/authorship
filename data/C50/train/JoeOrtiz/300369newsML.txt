This will represent the largest single extension of private share ownership ever witnessed in the UK, said Halifax chief executive Mike Blackburn. The Halifax, which has assets of over billion pounds, said its investment bank adviser Deutsche Morgan Grenfell had estimated a market price of between and pence per share if the flotation had taken place on December , . This would have meant a company worth between . and billion pounds and analysts expect the final outcome to be at the top end of this range, given the recent positive performance of the most comparable stock in the market former building society Abbey National Plc. The Halifax said each qualifying member will receive a basic allocation of shares in a flotation of . billion shares. The Halifax has . million investing members and . million borrowing members. Of these, there is an overlap , which means that the Society is sending out a total of around . million voting packs. Investing members will also get a variable share allocation depending on how much money they have in their accounts on particular dates, this will range from shares to a maximum of , for those with , pounds , or more. At its special general meeting on February , over percent of the investing members must vote in favour of the proposal or it will fail. The Halifax is expected to be in the top companies by market capitalisation in the FTSE index of blue chip firms and is sure to threaten the Abbey's position as Britain's fifth largest publicly quoted bank.

It joins the Woolwich, Alliance amp Leicester ALL.CN and Northern Rock who are all coming to the market this year in flotations worth an aggregate of around billion pounds.
