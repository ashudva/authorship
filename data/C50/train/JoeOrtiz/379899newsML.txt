Banking analysts said on Friday that Lloyds TSB Group Plc's percent headline rise in pretax profits was rather flattering and expressed some concern for future income growth. The pretax profit figure of . billion stg was just above top expectations although these had been expected to be bettered after some components of the group Lloyds Abbey Life and Cheltenham amp Gloucester recently reported higher than expected gains. There's nothing really wrong with the results, said John Leonard, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. But they are not as glorious as they look on the surface.

But Poutney, who has been advising clients to hold the shares but take profits, said he was now a seller. Overall, they are good figures but then it comes down to the valuation of the shares, Poutney said, and they are looking a bit expensive. I can't see them making much headway from here. Lloyds TSB shares stood p lower at p at GMT. Poutney expressed concern that costs, which were down in the first half, had ended the year virtually flat and also noted that income growth had slowed in the second six months.
