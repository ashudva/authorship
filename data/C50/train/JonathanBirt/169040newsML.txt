Dominion Resources Inc of the United States ended a day of rampant speculation on Wednesday by declaring it was interested in bidding for British power supply company East Midlands Electricity Plc. But the U.S. group, which owns power generator and distributor Virginia Power, made clear it would walk away from making a bid if East Midlands' share price continued to rocket on Thursday. East Midlands' share price leaped pence to close at pence on Wednesday, lifting the Nottingham based group's value to more than . billion pounds, as rumour swirled around it.

As well as Virginia Power, its main subsidiary, Dominion has a number of joint generation ventures in the U.S. and internationally, notably in South America.

Northern Electric, which is due to release sparkling half year results early in an attempt to attract a higher bid, saw its shares rise pence to pence on Thursday, adding to recent sharp gains.
