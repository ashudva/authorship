British clothing group Courtaulds Textiles Plc signalled on Tuesday that it plans to shift much of its production to cheaper Asian markets as it battles to return to profitability. The company, which is behind a host of famous brands including Gossard lingerie and Jockey underwear, refused to spell out details but said the shift will mean job losses in Britain and western Europe. It is to spend up to million pounds million restructuring its business and create four product led divisions. Exceptional charges helped push Courtaulds Textiles to a pre tax loss of . million pounds compared with a profit of . million in the first half last year. Excluding exceptional charges, pre tax profit fell to , pounds from . million. The depressed state of Britain's clothing industry is expected to be underlined on Wednesday when Courtaulds' rival Coats Viyella Plc, which unveiled a shock million pound restructuring charge in March, reveals its interim results.

He signalled his intention of moving the cost base from Britain and western Europe to lower cost manufacturing, and warned that opposition Labour Party plans to introduce a minimum wage in Britain would make matters worse. Dyer said the Far East offered clear advantages in terms of labour costs and access to raw materials. The group already operates in the Philippines and Thailand, where it makes stretch fabrics. The decline in first half profits was led by Courtaulds' fabrics division and resulted from weak demand in the U.S. and in continental European lace, as well as reorganisation costs. Courtaulds has sold around half its hit list of a dozen problem businesses, with three disposals announced last week, and Dyer said talks on one or two of the remaining sales are quite advanced.
