Chief executive David Barnes told Reuters the results showed the company was in touch with his ambitious target of doubling profits by the end of the century, but warned that spending on new products would restrain profits in the short term.

He said Zeneca had won its highest ever number of new drug approvals last year, and announced that a new migraine drug, Zomig, won its first approval wordlwide in Britain on Monday. Barnes said other promising products included the novel mild asthma tablet Accolate, which Zeneca said had sales of eight million pounds in its first few weeks of launch, schizophrenia treatment Seroquel and the fungicide Amistar. The company expects its capital spending to rise above the million pound level this year as it gears up for new production, while research and development spending is seen rising around percent after topping million pounds in . In we essentially, through increased capital expenditure and R amp D, invested one billion pounds in the medium and long term of the business, while making record profits of a billion pounds, generating cash and having an ungeared balance sheet, he told Reuters. Barnes, whose contract as chief executive expires in months time, would not rule out using the group's debt free balance sheet to make a major acquisition. We are very alive to new product opportunities. We are alive to regional infill opportunities if they were to strengthen our business. If a good opportunity were to present itself by way of acquisition we would look at it, but here is no strategic imperative to do that. We have got strong organic growth, Barnes said. .
