Colombia's main oil union postponed a decision to launch an indefinite strike in protest against the arrest of members on terrorism charges after top level talks with the government Sunday night, leaders said. The , strong USO union, known for its fiercely nationalistic stance, had been due to set a start date for a crippling stoppage at a general assembly Monday. Industrial action would have begun soon after Monday's meeting, union head Hernando Hern ndez said last week.
