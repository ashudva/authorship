Colombian President Ernesto Samper decreed an economic emergency on Monday, warning that the economic and social stability of the country was under threat. In a televised speech to the nation, Samper called for urgent belt tightening measures to cut the central government's yawning fiscal deficit. The economic emergency, the first in five years, has been decreed for days but could be extended for a maximum of days, presidential sources said. All measures in that period can be introduced without the approval of Congress. Further austerity measures are scheduled to be announced on Tuesday, government sources said.

We had initially been planning to launch a stoppage around mid February but this decree could force us to bring those plans radically forward. We could start a strike as early as next week, Borja said. Anticipating the unions' reaction, Samper said in his televised speech I want to warn you once and for all. Protests and strikes will lead nowhere quite simply because although the government has all the goodwill in the world, it is short of money. If the fiscal, exchange rate and unemployment situation continue to deteriorate, the social and economic order will seriously and ostensibly worsen... The economic stability of the country will be severely affected, the decree signed by Samper and his cabinet said. The crisis measure comes against the backdrop of a sharp economic slowdown in , coupled with a steady strengthening of the country's peso currency, which has undermined export activities.
