British pay television operator BSkyB said on Wednesday that it believed its planned channel digital satellite service would prove a hit with viewers. BSkyB, the dominant force in British pay TV, confirmed that it would proceed later this year with the launch of digital satellite into this country. It said that the plan was not affected by its new digital terrestrial television DTT alliance with leading commercial broadcasters Carlton Communications and Granada Group . The three have teamed up to form British Digital Broadcasting and apply for licences to run DTT networks when the channel service comes on air in Britain in mid . BSkyB is positioning itself to become a key player in digital, chief executive Sam Chisholm told a news conference. Digital satellite is going to be the primary driver of the new technology as it offers such a wide range of services, Chisholm added. BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the leading shareholder, earlier said pre tax profit rose percent to . million pounds . million in the six months to end December, up from . million a year ago. It reported record subscriber growth of , in the last three months of last year and now has over six million customers in Britain and Ireland. BSkyB shares continued their surge of recent days as markets welcomed the digital developments. BSkyB closed . p higher at . p, its best level for over three months. BSkyB said it expected shortly to confirm an order for up to one million digital satellite decoders from four manufacturers as it gears up for an autumn launch. It plans to work with partners to offer interactive services such as home shopping and home banking as part of the digital satellite package. Chisholm said a new company would be formed to subsidise the digital satellite decoder so that it could retail for around pounds. A decoder is needed to view any digital service. He did not name the members of the company, but BSkyB is reported to have had talks with British Telecommunications, Japanese electronics company Matsushita and bankers HSBC. BSkyB remained optimistic about the prospects for digital television in Germany, playing down the initial slow take up recorded by Kirch Gruppe's DF . If you can get it right, it's a hell of an opportunity, said Chisholm, noting that there are some million German speaking households in Europe. BSkyB agreed last year to take a stake of up to percent in DF but is yet to invest any money in the venture. DF was launched last July but recent reports suggest it has only attracted , subscribers. Chisholm said that DF 's slow take up was partly the result of market confusion. DF has been locked in a war with Premiere, another German pay TV venture. Kirch owns percent of Premiere but has fallen out with partners Bertelsmann and Canal Plus, who hold the remaining percent. Bertelsmann and Canal Plus want to develop Premiere into Germany's main digital television outlet but Kirch is backing its own DF for that role. . Pound
