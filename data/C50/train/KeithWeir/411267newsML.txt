Newcastle is the latest in a growing number of British soccer clubs to join the stock market. The value of listed clubs has soared over the past year as investors seek to cash in on the game's current boom. A lucrative contract with pay television giant British Sky Broadcasting Plc has helped to transform the game, enabling clubs to recruit top foreign stars and to upgrade once crumbling stadiums. English champions Manchester United have provided the model on and off the pitch, building a business valued at over million pounds in the six years since flotation.
