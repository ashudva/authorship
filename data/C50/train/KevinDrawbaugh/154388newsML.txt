TheraTx Inc does not expect the federal government to implement new guidelines for certain key Medicare reimbursement rates until the summer of , postponing until then any likely damage to the health care services concern's profitability. It's a government reimbursement change which is forthcoming. It will definitely pressure our earinings, there's no doubt about it, chief financial officer Donald Myll said in an interview. Like other companies that provide rehabilitation services to patients mostly in nursing homes, TheraTx has been waiting for two years for action from Washington on the reimbursement issue. The company's stock has been depressed during that time by a market unjustifiably focused on one issue, Myll said following a presentation to investors at a Robinson Humphrey conference here on Tuesday. At this point, I'd rather have bad news on salary equivalency than what we have now, which is no news, Myll said, referring to the issue.

If HCFA proceeds with its latest set of reforms, TheraTx could see earnings come in flat to down compared to this year's level, Myll said. Much remains to be determined, however, he said. Moreover, despite market concerns, the potential earnings hit from the changes is not large enough to hurt TheraTx seriously, he said. There's no real threat. It's a one time pricing issue.... The market has no clue on this, Myll said. TheraTx on Tuesday reported third quarter profits of . per share, up from . per share a year ago. The First Call consensus earnings forecast for the third quarter was . per share. The general performance of the company is on track. Whether per share net is . or . is not for me to say...but I would guess that analysts are probably going to revise their estimates downward because the third quarter was a couple pennies below the consensus, Myll said.
