Chicago Board of Trade Chairman Patrick Arbor said Thursday he expects electronic technology to replace open outcry trading in to years. I would think that in to years, there will be some kind of technology that will replace the traditional, open outcry market, Arbor said in answer to a student's question after a speech at the University of Chicago. In the past, the CBOT has said it views electronic trading as a supplement to open outcry pit trading, which it has said provides maximum integrity and liquidity at minimum cost. A CBOT press release distributed after Arbor's speech quoted him saying that electronic trading ... supplements open outcry during daytime hours and the evening session. In answer to the student's question, Arbor remarked that his year old son, a CBOT member allowed to trade in the pits, has got about years left in his trading career. Arbor added, Technology is the wave of the future. There's no question about it. Electronic trading remains a small part of the total volume of trading done on the CBOT, but is growing rapidly. Total trading volume on the exchange in was more than million contracts and Arbor predicted record setting volume in . Electronic trading increased to an average daily volume of , contracts in the first quarter of from just contracts in , when it commenced. The growth of electronic trading is here. It's going to continue, Arbor said. He said he expects the CBOT the world's largest futures exchange soon to move away from paper orders. He said, My prediction would be that in three to five years, the Board of Trade floor ... will be completely paperless and pretty much automated as far as the entering and exiting of orders.
