Optus, established at the start of to compete with Australia's main telephone carrier, state owned Telstra Corp, reported a pre tax profit of A . million US . million in the year to June , . This compares with a loss of A . million in . After a tremendous effort during its first few years, Optus is now in a very strong position to capitalise on the many opportunities presented by the rapidly growing telecommunications industry, chief executive officer Zygmunt Switkowski said in a statement. The profit was within expectations. Telecommunications analysts forecast Optus to deliver a profit before abnormals of between A million and A million. I don't think the market will be disappointed, said one Sydney based analyst. I think the revenue is a little bit down on what they were talking about. The results reflected strong revenue growth of percent to A . billion in , with high revenue increases from its three main businesses of mobile telephones, long distance calls and services to the corporate and government sector, chief operating officer Phil Jacobs said on Wednesday. Optus, . percent owned each by U.S. BellSouth Corp and Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc, said in February it expected to achieve A . billion in revenue in . The Sydney based group is still expected to make its sharemarket debut by the end of , Switkowski said. The float's planned to occur this side of Christmas and the prospectus is progressing to plan, but it is not done, he told reporters after the results anouncement. The float is expected to raise around A . billion, making it the largest telecommunications company to list on the Australian Stock Exchange, with up to percent of the company shares to be listed. Optus will later be joined by Telstra on the stock exchange. The Australian government plans to raise A . billion from the sale of one third of Telstra in , which will be just after full deregulation of Australia's telecommunications industry on July , . Despite chalking up its first annual profit, Optus incurred increased losses from its . percent owned pay television and local telephone call operator Optus Vision. Optus said its share of losses from Optus Vision was A . million, which were mainly due to the start up of the offshoot, which is spending A . billion rolling out its nationwide fibre optic cable network to provide pay TV and telephone services. Optus Vision, which includes Australia's richest man Kerry Packer amongst its shareholders, reported a loss of A . million in , in its first year of operation. The company has not announced its results. Switkowski was coy about forecasts. Optus Communications was completing its prospectus for the sharemarket float, which would contain revenue and profit forecasts. However, Switkowski predicted that revenue from its mobile telephone business would exceed revenues from its long distance calls due to strong local demand, as Australia has one of the highest penetration rates for mobile phones in the world.
