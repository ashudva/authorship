Analysts had forecast net profit before abnormal items would be around A million, up around percent. Net profit before abnormals came in at A million. The poor result caused News Corp shares to fall sharply and dragged the whole Australian share market lower. The share price fall wiped over A million of the group's market capitalisation. The stock closed cents or . percent lower at A . with over . million shares traded. The weaker profit was a result of poorer returns in U.S. TV, Australian newspapers and book publishing, News Corp said. This is not as people were expecting type of result. It was a very flat result, one Sydney based media analyst said.
