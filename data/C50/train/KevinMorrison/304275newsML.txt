The long awaited turnaround in Australia's housing market is expected to occur during but it is unlikely to signal a repeat of the boom seen in the s or the most recent peak in the year. Lower immigration levels Australia are seen as a major reason for the subdued demand for housing, analysts said. However the anticipated housing recovery would be welcomed by building material companies, hardware chains and consumer goods manufacturers, who have blamed the recent housing slump for a fall in profits over the past months. House construction is expected to total , homes in the year to June , up from , a year earlier, according to the government's housing forecaster, the Indicative Planning Council IPC . However this forecast is in doubt, according to building industry body, the Master Builders Association MBA , which has said total building approvals needed to rise by around percent to meet the forecast. The forecast is well down on the , homes built in the high point and the , level reached in the previous peak in . IPC forecasts housing starts to average , a year to the year.In the three years to homes built averaged , per year.

Migration would have to go through the , level before it could give a major boost to the Sydney and Melbourne markets, Sibree told Reuters.

In the longer term I don't think we are going to see the massive growth we have seen in the past or years. We just don't have that sort of population growth, Cobbold said. Cobbold said the HIA plans a study into the effects of immigration on Australia on economic, social and cultural levels. The study is expected to be completed by mid . Sydney Newsroom
