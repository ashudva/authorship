Media analysts contacted by Reuters estimated Fairfax to report a net profit before abnormals of between A million and A million for the first half. Fairfax reported a . percent fall in net profit to A . million for the half. However, they said the result should show improving advertising revenue in the second quarter, along with lower newsprint costs. They have certainly seen a pick up in ad volumes. It is still down on last year but nowhere near as much down as in the first quarter, said Nola Hodgson, analyst at HSBC James Capel. Hodgson tips a net profit of A million to A million, with the dividend remaining at . cents for the half. Vince Pepe at broker Burdett Buckeridge and Young estimated Fairfax to report a net profit of A million for the half and A . million for the year.
