Misys, Britain's fast growing, million pound software supply giant, said on Wednesday it was looking at four or five international acquisition targets worth up to million each. Chairman Kevin Lomax told Reuters that Misys, which has snapped up software trading firms in South East Asia, Ireland, the U.S. and Europe, was keen on businesses that operated within a strong international financial services market. They possible acquisition targets are worth mainly between . million to million and we might do one, we might do four, Lomax said. With . million pounds of cash and an undisclosed, but low gearing level, Lomax said the company had plently of headroom in its cash flow and borrowing facilities to enable it to embark again on the acquisition trail. Supplying software to banks and insurers has brought rich rewards to Misys. The group earlier raised pretax profits in the half year by percent to . million pounds on revenues of . million pounds a percent rise. Lomax said he saw the possibility of creating quite a bit of shareholder value by buying regional software companies, particularly in the banking industry. Misys, whose banking division alone now supplies software to , banks and , installations, has become one of the world's largest application software companies as consolidation in the industry gathers pace. In the last months, its shares have almost doubled to pence from pence as it systematically targets international financial institutions that need new software at lower costs but with a greater security of transactions. Lomax insists that he is unworried by the share price, which at about times prospective earnings, no longer looks cheap. Competitors' PE ratios are comparable, he says. But the stock slipped . p to p despite record results. The company has bought software businesses in risk management, private banking, corporate electronic banking, derivatives trading, capital markets trading areas where banks and securities firms want to expand and control their activities. Internal production is not meeting the time to market requirements that these companies have so they tend to look outside to other software products, Lomax says. Only last month, Misys announced the planned million acquistion of Summit Systems, a New York computer company specialising in financial derivatives trading software. In terms of international banking, Misys is three to five times bigger than its next competitor. Rivals such as Reuters Holdings and America's SunGard Data Systems impinge only on parts of its market, Lomax noted. Nobody of any serious calibre or size competes across the board with us.
