The BBC announced historic plans to break into the domestic commercial television market on Monday, linking up with British satellite cable broadcaster Flextech Plc to offer up to eight new pay television channels. Flextech, majority owned by America's biggest cable television group Tele Communications International Inc, is contributing million pounds . million of equity and can make million pounds in credit facilities available to the ventures. Flextech and BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm, announced in September an agreement to form a joint venture to create a series of mainly digital subscription television channels in Britain, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Irish Republic. After months of negotiations, the two companies announced that, subject to shareholder approval, they planned to form two joint ventures which will combine the BBC's diverse archive, scheduling and production skills with Flextech's multi channel television management and marketing knowledge. The principal deal will be to develop and launch, mainly in digital format, a number of new pay television channels in Britain. The second is to buy out and develop in analogue and, in due course, in digital formats what is currently UK Gold, one of the most successful channels transmitted by one of British Sky Broadcasting 's multi channel packages. The joint ventures with the BBC represent a major opportunity for the long term development of Flextech and the consoldiation of its position in the multi channel television market in the UK, Flextech's chief executive Roger Luard said. Dubbed Horizons, Style, Learning, Arena, Showcase, Sports Entertainment Network, One TV and Catch up TV, the eight planned channels include documentaries, consumer, educational and arts programmes, drama, comedy, sport, music and high profile programmes to be aired shortly after first transmission on BBC and BBC . Under terms of its licence, the BBC has to show its programmes first for free to domestic British audiences who fund the corporation though television licences. These channels will have widespread appeal and will, we believe, play an important role in the future growth and development of multi channel television, Luard said. Flextech and the BBC confirmed that they would give the first option for the transmission of up to five of the digital channels to British satellite operator BSkyB 's consortium.
