Apple Computer Inc. Wednesday reported a million loss in its fiscal first quarter and warned investors it did not expect to report a profit until September. The troubled computer maker, based in Cupertino, Calif., also said it expected revenue for the current fiscal year, which ends next September, to drop about percent to billion to . billion because of weak consumer sales. Apple's loss, which equaled cents a share, compared with a loss of million, or cents a share, in the year ago quarter. Sales for the quarter ended Dec. fell to . billion from . billion. Apple attributed the latest quarterly loss to slow sales of consumer oriented Performa desktop computers during the crucial Christmas quarter, which analysts said was partly due to concerns about Apple's future. Apple's been under a black cloud, and part of it has been Apple's doing, said Lou Mazzucchelli, analyst at brokerage Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. It's hard for a consumer to get the gumption to buy a Performa when everyone's asking, 'Is Apple dead yet ' Apple officials said the company will unveil in coming weeks its second restructuring program in two years, aimed at cutting operating costs by million. The plan could include more job cuts, Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson said. Apple wants to reduce its break even point to billion in annual revenues to enable it to return to profitability by the end of September. Previously, Apple had promised to return to sustainable profits by March. But industry analysts had started to question that goal after Apple disclosed less than two weeks ago that sales of its Performa line were running behind plan. Apple, which posted a record loss last year of million, has been struggling to return to profitability in the face of increased competition from computers using Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system and Intel Corp.'s computer chips.

Despite its position among the top five worldwide personal computer manufacturers ... Apple has been struggling with extremely competitive industry conditions, slipping market share, and operating losses, the rating agency said. Despite the slowdown in Performa sales, Anderson said Apple's financial position remained strong. While we were very disappointed by the Performa sales results and the associated loss, our financial position remains sound, he said. We exited the quarter with . billion in cash. Anderson said there were some bright spots in its results. European shipments rose percent in the first quarter from the fourth quarter. Sales to educational organizations also were above the company's goals, Anderson said. Still, Performa sales, which account for about a third of Apple's revenues, will be weak for the rest of the year. We had a major problem in this one product area, he said. Analysts said the loss, which Apple forecast two weeks ago, represented a setback for Amelio. He had set a goal of stanching Apple's losses in and getting revenue growing again by . News of the latest loss can drive even more consumers to avoid buying Apple products, analysts said. The question is, can Apple wait until to get its growth engine going again said Walter Winnitzki, analyst at broker PaineWebber Inc. in New York. Apple reported its results after the market closed.
