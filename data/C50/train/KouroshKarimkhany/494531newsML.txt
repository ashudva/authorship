AMD Chairman Jerry Sanders said all of the company's businesses improved over the fourth quarter, when AMD posted a loss of . million, or cents a share. Recovering strength in all sectors of our business produced the sales growth necessary for AMD to return to modest profitability even before volume shipments of AMD K MMX processors, Sanders said, referring to AMD's newest chip. Revenue growth was led by flash memories, Microsoft Windows compatible microprocessors, and programmable logic devices from our Vantis division. Last week, AMD introduced the K chip, a microprocessor for standard personal computers that can handle basic calculations slightly faster than Intel's top of the line Pentium Pro chip. Based on expected demand for an alternative to Intel's pricey offerings and improving operations, AMD stock has doubled since the beginning of the year. Sanders said the company shipped only , K chips during the quarter. He said, however, that AMD plans to increase production substantially in the new few months. We are ramping production in order to ship hundreds of thousands of AMD K MMX processors during the current quarter, and millions of units in the second half of , Sanders said in a statement. In order to boost acceptance for its new chip, AMD is embarking on an aggressive marketing campaign, starting with TV commercials this week on the popular NBC sitcom Seinfeld . Intel, the world's biggest maker of computer chips, has spent millions in the past three years on the Intel Inside campaign, even though Intel's chips are the brains of about percent of the world's PCs. Before the K , AMD's microprocessors had been at least three years behind Intel in computing horsepower. It did not have to counter Intel's marketing juggernaut because its customers mainly were second tier PC makers that bought its chips for low priced machines. Two years ago, the company gambled its financial future to make sure that the K was just as fast, or faster, than comparable Intel chips. The gamble paid off, at least technically. The K beats the Pentium Pro in most everyday applications, according to trade magazines. Not only that, AMD plans to sell it for at least percent less than the Pentium. Armed with the K , AMD now plans to chase Intel's best customers makers of high end professional and consumer PCs.
