Up to one million tonnes of soybean meal is clogging Chinese ports, filling warehouses and forcing domestic prices down, traders said on Wednesday. There is no demand, said one U.S. trader. Of the million tonnes estimated to be sitting in Chinese ports, either on ships or in warehouses, , tonnes is in southern Guangdong, one source said. The market has dropped and the buyers are stuck with the meal, the source said. Feed mills were buying on a hand to mouth basis, keeping minimum stocks and hoping to squeeze desperate importers on the price, said a trader in Shanghai. When they find all the port stocks are consumed, they will start increasing their buying but that won't be for a while and who knows when, he said. Traders polled by Reuters varied in their view of just when the stocks would dwindle to a point that will inspire buying the optimists said late February, the pessimists plumbed for as late as July. In the meantime, the domestic Chinese price of soybean meal has plunged around percent in the past six weeks, traders said, from , , yuan a tonne, to , , yuan a tonne now. Soybean meal prices on the Chicago Board of Trade CBOT ended mostly firm on Tuesday, closing . per tonne higher to cents lower, with March up . to . per tonne. Thai traders reported on Tuesday that Chinese buyers of Indian origin soybean meal had defaulted on some cargoes because the market could not absorb the huge quantities on the way. China's soybean meal arrivals in the last quarter of were between one and . million tonnes, traders said, with loading and shipping delays pushing back the landing time of large quantities from South America and the United States. Our vessels with an ETA estimated time of arrival around mid December all arrived in January, said the Shanghai source. Another said his company currently had vessels in four or five Chinese ports awaiting discharge and facing demurrage charges. A trading source in Singapore said , tonnes of meal was due to arrive and or discharge at Chinese ports this month. On top of that, , to , tonnes of soybeans would be discharged in China before the Lunar New Year vacation begins on February , he said. It will be interesting to see how all this is absorbed by the market, another trading source said. Overbuying in and delayed arrivals were compounded by a decision in December by Heilongjiang province to allow the sale of unprocessed soybeans to other parts of the country for the first time in more than three years. Heilongjiang, in the far northeast, is China's biggest soybean producer, with output estimated at . million tonnes, down slightly from . While prices in the province had suffered from the moratorium, the decision to lift the non value added sales ban had had little impact on farmers' prices, the U.S. source said. The Shanghai trader, however, said that fundamental demand in China for beans as food, rather than feed, kept prices steady. In Shanghai now, prices are , yuan per tonne for beans, and of that , goes back to Heilongjiang. That's not bad, he said.
