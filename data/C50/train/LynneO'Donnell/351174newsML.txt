Far East metals traders on Monday waited for London Metal Exchange LME reaction to reports that Australia's MIM will halve zinc supplies to Europe. MIM Holdings Ltd said it was holding talks with customers worldwide on the impact of reduced zinc production this year. Nick Stump, chief executive of MIM, declined to comment on a Reuters report quoting european smelter sources as saying that MIM would reduce zinc supplies to Europe by half this year. There is definitely a shift to Asia, although to what extent we will have to wait and see, Stump told Reuters in Sydney.

Last trade on Friday was , , up a tonne. China exports around a quarter of its annual zinc output. Official figures show exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys rose to , tonnes, over 's , tonnes. December exports alone were , tonnes. Asian trading sources said that while the impact of the MIM news on Chinese prices would be limited, the continuing climb of world prices would encourage China's zinc producers to export. Chinese smelters are looking at the LME price and so domestic supply is quite high now, the Chinese trader, who represents Chinese producers in Hong Kong, said.

Long term export contracts done by his company had been settled at , per tonne FOB free on board at major Chinese ports, he said.

This is a fairly heavy level of activity, he said, adding that most of the material in Singapore was being kept off warrant and therefore would not show up in LME stock figures. We are not putting what we buy on warrant, but selling directly to customers, Kumar said. Kumar predicted a rise in LME stocks on Tuesday of around , tonnes. LME zinc stocks on Friday stood at , tonnes. A metals trader in Shanghai said unregistered Chinese zinc ingots were arriving at major Chinese ports at the LME spot price, less a tonne on quality.

Copper premiums were firming in some areas of the region, another trading source said. Premiums to South Korea had firmed in the past week to a tonne, from last week, on rumours of a major short position being held there. Premiums on arrivals at major Japanese and Taiwanese ports were steady at around a tonne, traders said.
