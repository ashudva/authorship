As China winds down from a two week Spring Festival holiday and warmer weather looms, Far East metals traders forecast on Monday that demand for Chinese base metals would begin to pick up. Some traders said physical tightness of some materials, especially copper and aluminium, would push premiums higher. A trader based in Hong Kong with a major Chinese metals producing firm said mainland customers who had bought three months ahead of the new year holiday were now clamouring for nearby delivery. I will have to contact the LME London Metal Exchange and arrange to borrow because they want their tonnes before the end of this month, he said. We're expecting our customers to buy, though many are holding on for price falls, he said, adding that high LME prices should soon prompt a profit taking related correction.

A long awaited correction in the aluminium price had brought Chinese buyers out of their holiday cocoon, he said, adding however that he had no details of Chinese orders.
