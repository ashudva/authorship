French chemical group Rhone Poulenc SA and Merck amp Co Inc of the U.S. announced on Thursday they were merging their animal health activities to create the world leader in the sector. The new joint venture company Merial, with estimated sales of . billion, will be the market leader in biology products, veterinary drugs and poultry drugs, they said. In the animal health sector Merial will overtake Pfizer Smithkline Beecham, Bayer and Novartis the recent merger between Ciba Geigy AG and Sandoz AG of Switzerland. Igor Landau, managing director of Rhone Poulenc, told a news conference the merger would cut costs and have an effect on jobs, although it was too early to give details. It will not be in France that the impact will be most pronounced, he said, adding that the merger would have a positive effect on Rhone's results. Merck will make an unspecified payment to Rhone for the parity. Taking everything into account, the valuation of our business was higher than that of Merck, Landou said, because Rhone's growth potential was higher. The joint venture will merge the animal health activities of Rhone Merieux and Merck AgVet. It will be headed in the first few years by Merck's John Preston, while Rhone's Louis Champel will become chief executive of Merial and will succeed Preston.

Rhone Merieux's main product is the recently launched Frontline, which has had sales this year of million and expects them to doublein . Merial will benefit from the launch of a number of new Merck products in the coming years while a new jointly developed product will be ready in three years. The real creation of added value is in innovation, Landau said, stressing the possible synergies of the joint research and development.

He said that Rhone's animal health activities had a profitabilty of . percent in operating income as a percentage of sales and of some percent in operating income as a percentage of working capital. Merck's profitability is largely higher than that. The Merial merger is the latest of a series of big corporate moves in animal health.
