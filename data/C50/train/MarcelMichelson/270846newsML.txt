Philippe Jaffre, chairman of French oil group Elf Aquitaine, is entering the last lap of an ambitious restructuring drive to cut the formerly state owned conglomerate back to its core oil and chemicals activities. After a three year programme to sell assets from a treasury trove lovingly amassed by state appointed predecessors such as Loik Le Floch Prigent now in jail pending trial on fraud charges Jaffre this week said he was ready to give up control of the health and beauty products unit Sanofi. Sanofi, in which Elf holds percent, has a promising product pipeline but needs money to get them to market quickly. Its chief executive Jean Francois Dehecq also has ambitions to play a part in the global pharmaceutical industry's restructuring and needs more financial support. At a board meeting on Wednesday at Elf's imposing glass office tower in Paris's La Defense business district, Jaffre told Dehecq Elf would not commit money to a Sanofi expansion but freed the unit to engage in talks toward an alliance. Jaffre wanted to send a signal to other pharmaceutical companies that Sanofi is in play, a company source said. Jaffre had previously said Elf would not invest a lot of money in Sanofi because it was trying to reduce its own debt and improve its profitability.

He said he aimed to sell billion francs of industrial assets and six billion of financial assets to cut the debt which stood at percent of equity. Most of this programme has been carried out, company sources said. Jaffre cut investment in the ambitious Leuna refinery project in former East Germany, sold stakes in Entreprise Oil in Britain and Petrofina in Belgium and most recently a stake in Compagnie de Suez.
