Franco Italian semiconductor group SGS Thomson Microelectronics NV said on Wednesday earnings rose percent to . million, but issued a warning on the first quarter of after a weak end to last year. A . percent fourth quarter drop to million contrasted with a near doubling of Intel Corp's profit in the same period. The U.S. company's report on January had boosted SGS Thomson shares on bullish expectations. SGS Thomson's president and chief executive Pasquale Pistorio said he was pleased with the performance. But he was cautious about the first quarter of , although he said the company would still outperform the industry average. With lead times shrinking throughout the industry, we are entering the first quarter of with less order visibility than we have historically enjoyed, he said in a statement. From what we know today, we expect first quarter revenues to be close to third quarter levels. We also anticipate that overall pricing pressures will continue, and therefore, in spite of productivity improvements, gross margins could be slightly below fourth quarter levels, he added. In the third quarter of , net revenues were . million. While first quarter conditions continue to be uncertain, we believe that subsequent quarters of will show progressive improvement compared to the first quarter as the company continues to emphasise differentiated products and high growth applications, Pistorio added. Recent contracts with key customers and new design wins in such high growth areas as hard disk drives, set top boxes and digital cellular phones give us confidence that SGS Thomson will continue to outperform the industry average in , he said. SGS Thomson, whose shares are listed in Paris and New York, is percent owned by two consortia, one French and one Italian, reflecting its formation in a merger of a French and Italian microchip company. Pistorio said the results were achieved in difficult market conditions. Prices of Dynamic Random Access Memory DRAM have plunged and caused losses at many chipmakers. SGS Thomson, however, does not make DRAMs but dedicated chips which shielded it somewhat from price erosion. Our concentration on differentiated products provided consistency to our financial results throughout a period that was characterised by industry wide volatility, Pistorio said. Full year revenues rose to . billion from . billion. Capital expenditure rose to . billion from . billion and research and development spending was up by percent to . million, or . percent of sales.
