Australian gambling group Tabcorp Holdings Ltd is praying for Melbourne Cup fever to grip the betting public next Tuesday and give the company a chance of winning back some lost turnover from its wagering division. Tabcorp managing director Ross Wilson told the firm's annual meeting here on Tuesday that total turnover rose percent in its first quarter ended September, due entirely to a percent surge in turnover on its , slot machines around the state. In contrast, its wagering division suffered an abysmal start to the current fiscal year ending June , , he said.
