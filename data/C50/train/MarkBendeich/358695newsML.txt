Australia's biggest retailer, Coles Myer Ltd, reported on Wednesday a firm rise in sales revenue, signalling the worst may be over for the country's long suffering merchants. Coles announced a . percent rise in sales revenue to A . billion US . billion for the six months to January , sounding a rare note of optimism in an industry that has been hit hard by a downturn in consumer spending. Coles, which pockets almost cents in every retail dollar spent in Australia, attributed the result to good management rather than any pick up in the economy. A lot of people have done a lot of work to get where we needed to get, Coles chief executive Dennis Eck told Reuters. But Coles' announcement came a day after another retailer, David Jones Ltd, reassessed its profit outlook, painting a slighter brighter picture than the bleak dive in earnings it forecast just after Christmas.

Australian retail sales are at their lowest ebb since the nation's official statistician began counting them years ago. They have fallen in trend terms in each of the past five months. Employment has also been weak with Australia's jobless rate hovering at . percent. Coles confirmed on Wednesday that trading conditions were still tough, especially in clothing and fashion. The group's only specialist apparel chain, Katies, reported a . percent drop in turnover in the latest sales figures. But Coles' Eck said profit margins in its underperforming department store chains were improving, as store managers improved the quality of merchandise sold and pared back costs. In sharp contrast to the group's . percent fall in net profit in , Eck said he expected an increase in bottom line earnings for the current year ending July . Our earnings are in line with our plan, he said. Coles reported net profit of A million in , and stock analysts are forecasting a modest profit rise in . A US .
