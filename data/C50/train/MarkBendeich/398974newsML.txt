Australia's biggest aluminium producer, Comalco Ltd, plunged into the red on Monday, blaming weak prices, a strong local dollar and higher smelting costs. Comalco announced a loss of A . million US . million in calendar , compared with a net profit after abnormals of A . million in . Before abnormals, earnings were in line with market expectations at A . million, a fraction of the result. The result made only a brief dent in Comalco's share price, which was battered in recent months in anticipation of a slide in earnings. The shares fell eight cents on the news, but rebounded to end at A . , up six cents from Friday's close.

Comalco saw firming global demand for the metal this year, fuelled by economic recovery in Europe and continued growth in the United States. Consumption in Asia is not expected to grow in , the company said. Comalco also denied market speculation it might sell off its smelters and abandon its plan to build a A billion alumina refinery in either Queensland state or Sarawak, Malaysia. Alumina, produced from bauxite, is the raw material for making aluminium. The current talk about that withdrawing from smelting is one hell of a way wide of the mark, Palmer said. The position with the alumina project remains unchanged, he added. Comalco hopes to start building the refinery, with annual capacity of one million to . million tonnes, in . Site selection will depend heavily on the kind of power contracts Queensland and Malaysia can offer, Palmer said. A US .
