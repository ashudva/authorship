Australia's Woodside Petroleum Ltd on Wednesday announced it would ramp up exploration spending this year as it sought to diversify away from the lucrative gas fields of the North West Shelf. Woodside unveiled its aggressive exploration programme for calendar , much of its centred outside the offshore North West Shelf fields, after reporting a percent surge in annual net earnings to A million for . Woodside's shares shot up on the profit announcement, which was in line with market expectations. The stock closed at the day's high of A . on Wednesday, up cents on Tuesday's close, confirming the market's bright view of Woodside. Woodside said it would more than double exploration spending in to a record A million with over half of this being thrown at the company's interests in the Timor Sea. Certainly this is an order of magnitude increase in non North West Shelf exploration activity, Akehurst told a news conference in Melbourne. Woodside plans to drill to exploration wells, including eight or nine outside the North West Shelf, he added. Akehurst also announced in North West Shelf's proven reserves, with ultimate gas recovery leaping percent to . trillion cubic feet tcf at the end of . Oil reserves rose percent to million barrels and condensate reserves were up percent to million barrels. Woodside expressed confidence the North West Shelf would meet the tcf in gas reserves needed to justify a doubling of LNG capacity to meet growing demand from Japanese customers. Quite clearly we see considerable upside..., Akehurst said, citing estimated possible reserves of tcf. Equal partners in the North West Shelf are Woodside, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, The British Petroleum Co Plc, Japan Australia LNG MiMi Pty Ltd, a partnership of Mitsui amp Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Corp, Chevron Corp and the Royal Dutch Shell Group. The six partners plan to double annual LNG production to million tonnes by at a capital cost of A billion. The North West Shelf partners and owners of the nearby Gorgon gas field have been discussing the prospects of merging the two developments, with a view to expanding the North West Shelf's existing LNG plant further. I think the exciting prospect is to see how we can move on from there and look for opportunities with third parties to expand that project, Akehurst said. He said he would welcome any proposal to merge Gorgon with North West Shelf production to cooperate on a sixth and seventh train . Currently, the North West Shelf partners plan to expand their Burrup Pensinsula plant to five trains. Chevron, Texaco Inc and Shell each hold two seventh stakes in Gorgon, with Mobil Corp owning one seventh. Melbourne bureau
