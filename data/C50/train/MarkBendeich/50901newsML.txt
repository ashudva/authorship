Industrial conglomerate Pacific Dunlop Ltd will announce another heavy fall in annual net profit on Friday, with abnormal losses possibly sinking the bottom line into red ink, stock analysts said on Thursday. PacDun, dogged by litigation over problems with its U.S. made cardiac implants and by weak economic growth at home and abroad, has already softened the blow by warning investors last May that annual profit would be percent lower. The warning pared forecasts of pre abnormal net profit down to an average of A million for the year to June , said BZW Investment Management's BARCEPS forecasting service. This compares with a pre abnormal result of A million and a first half pre abnormal result of A million. But the group a major international producer of rubber consumer goods, car batteries and tyres, industrial cables and clothing is likely to book a large net abnormal loss of up to A million, Macquarie Equities analyst Greg Dring said. Pacific Dunlop's troubled U.S. medical equipment unit, Telectronics, which accounted for A . million in abnormal losses in , will again incur big provisions for costs associated with its pacemaker leads, he said. Dring estimated that these provisions could account in for about A million of a total net abnormal loss estimated at up to A million, he added. He said he assumed the group would not book a tax benefit on these losses.
