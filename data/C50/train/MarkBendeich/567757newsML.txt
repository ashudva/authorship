The former chief of Australia's biggest retailer was jailed on Wednesday for four years for defrauding the company of A . million US . million in what the judge called a s case of greed and excess. Former Coles Myer Ltd chief executive Brian Quinn, convicted last month of using company funds to make lavish renovations to his Melbourne mansion, stood ashen faced in the courtroom and nodded in meek resignation at the sentence. Judge Geoff Eames ordered that Quinn, , who ran the company for six years until he retired in , not be eligible for parole until he had spent two and a half years in prison. Eames accused Quinn of greed, vanity and extravagance and said he had shown no remorse.

It remains a criminal offence to plunder the assets of a company, whatever the opinion held by the thief of his own worth to the company.

Bingham drew a comparison with s high flier Alan Bond, who was sentenced to four years' jail in February for his role in Australia's biggest case of corporate fraud, worth A billion. Mr Quinn, he has been a victim, Bingham said. Quinn has repaid over A million of the funds defrauded. A US .
