Australian paper and packaging giant Amcor Ltd, continuing a run of depressing profit results and forecasts, said on Tuesday that it hoped the worst would be over in July June . Amcor managing director Don Macfarlane said full year net profit would be lower than the A . million achieved in but he saw paper prices rising from early calendar . If you read the things we have said since the half year profit announcement you would have to come to that conclusion, Macfarlane told Reuters. Hopefully this is the worst of it, he added. His comments followed a statement in which Amcor said second half results would be lower than a year ago and than the first half. There would also be some significant write downs.
