Microsoft Corp Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown reiterated Thursday that he expects results in the current fourth quarter to be similar to the just ended third quarter, which he called sizzling. But in an interview, Brown also said he expects Microsoft's growth to slow over the next five quarters based on difficult comparisons and a lack of planned major new upgrades. While the current fourth quarter is expected to show results similar to the . billion in net income and . billion in revenues posted for the period that ended March , Brown said the first quarter of fiscal could show a sequential downturn. Brown said he expected results to rise sequentially after that. Brown also said that while the company's high end Windows NT Workstation operating system is being pre loaded on some new personal computers, the mix shift was not yet material to Microsoft's so called OEM original equipment manufacturer revenues. It's just going to be more of a fiscal ' phenomenon, not a ' phenomenon, he said. Brown said he expected a spike in revenues from the Office upgrade would begin to tail off in the current quarter, although deferred revenues from product shipped earlier would prevent a sequential downturn. The next upgrade of Office will not be out until fiscal , Brown said. So fiscal ' is in the product cycle valley from a comparison standpoint, and that makes the comparison tough, even if business fundamentals are very good, Brown said. And he said he expected the revenue surge from the higher priced Windows operating system to begin to tail off soon now that the product has been out months. Brown said he was very excited about the long term future but said the earnings bar had been raised to an all time Olympic record. We haven't had very many quarters in which EPS went up percent, he said. That's not a quarter in, quarter out type of thing. This is just an incredible quarter. Reuters Seattle bureau
