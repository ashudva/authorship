Rains in Ivory Coast's southern cocoa belt picked up in late February and an overall deficit stretching into March has not stressed trees too much, weather and crop analysts said on Tuesday. Rains have continued along the south coast and in forest areas, and soon we expect them to start moving further to the north, said a national weather centre spokesman on Tuesday, adding that there was no reason for trees to be over stressed. Crop analysts said trees were beginning to show some reaction to prolonged dry weather but no signs of damage. People are forgetting that we had over percent of normal rains in December and January, said one. We will be in trouble if there are no rains in March but all the signs indicate that will just not be the case. Ivorian commodities minister Guy Alain Gauze said on Monday the crop would be less than one million tonnes, despite private estimates of up to . million. The weather has been very dry, despite reports that it has been raining recently...We do not call this rain, he said. Little or no rain fell in most areas during the first days of February leading to concern that possible damage to trees would reduce mid crop April Sept potential and reduce bean sizes in developing pods. But official data for the last eight days of the month show average rainfall at weather stations of . mm, against . mm in the previous days and . mm for the last eight days of February last year. Ivory Coast produced a record . million tonnes crop after a bumper , tonnes mid crop. Some industry forecasters raised crop estimates after strong main crop arrivals. Mid crop prospects are expected to be clearer by mid March as pod counters complete tallies. Late mid crop volumes depend partly on rains up to April. Normally we get a bit more rain in early March but they are a bit late, said the weather centre spokesman. If dry weather continues until the end of the month trees might be over stressed but some stress is normal for this time of year. A crop analyst said, There is some yellowing of leaves which we usually see in January, but I am not worried. Others returning from growing areas said drizzle had fallen in southern regions with isolated thunderstorms. There was not much rain but we are still optimistic that levels will increase soon, one said. My figures show average rainfall of mm for February against an average mm. Late rains and a mild January harmattan wind meant the effects of drought in February had not been as harsh as might otherwise have been the case, said crop analaysts. On some eastern cocoa and coffee plantations, fires that had been started to clear undergrowth had got out of control. There has been some damage to badly maintained plantations but on farms we usually visit the fire swept through undergrowth in a flash and did not affect trees, said one crop analyst. Overall, there doesn't appear to have been much serious damage at all, he said. It sounds worse than it is, although some coffee farms were burnt to the ground. Data from the national weather stations showed the following total rainfall for the last eight days of February in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan previous days in brackets Dalao . mm , Gagnoa . mm , San Pedro . mm . , Tabou mm . and Man . mm , Dimbokro . , Yamoussoukro mm , Abidjan . mm . , Sassandra . mm , Adiake . mm . , Korhogo mm .
