Ivory Coast is planning to streamline management of mining policy to cut red tape and attract more investors to its expanding gold mining sector. There should be some big changes in about three weeks, a foreign advisor to the Ministry of Mines told Reuters. Existing rules will not change but management will be tightened to make things run smoothly. Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, introduced a new mining code in to simplify rules for investors and broaden its agriculture dependent economy. Ministry of Mines officials said around companies holding a total of over exploration permits were searching mainly for gold and nickel. Firms rushing to West Africa since the Cold War ended have been attracted by Ivorian political and mining code reforms. Three new permits were approved in March alone but prospectors, and two working gold mines, point to bureaucracy which they say still dogs operations. They want decision times cut and better coordination between mining and other ministries. What the Minister of Finance and what the Minister of Mines says are two different things, Philippe Palanque, managing director of Ivory Coast's largest mine, SMI Societe des Mines d'Ity , which is prospecting around its existing site. Administrative decisions are sometimes taken all the way up to the Prime Minister, said another exploration geologist. Ivory Coast's annual gold output of less than three tonnes a year is dwarfed by mining giant Ghana's annual output of tonnes. Recent finds in Mali are set to at least double national production to over tonnes, but underlying Birimian greenstone geology is similar throughout the sub region. Ivory Cost had no mining experience like Ghana, so development has been slow while Mali and Burkina have raced ahead in the 's, Joe Hinzer, General Manager at Ivory Coast's other gold mine SOMIAF Societe Miniere d'Afema told Reuters. Ivory Coast has good potential but discoveries like Ghana and Mali follow no rhyme or reason, said one geologist, adding that a find of one million ounces would be seen as good. SMI opened in and was privatised last year. It predicts a gold production, by leaching ores with cyanide, of , kilos in after ouptut of , last year. SOMIAF says its production is set to jump to kilos against last year and has started feasibility studies for expanding operations in the next three years. Newcomers are undeterrred by small gold ouptut, pointing to geological potential, infrastructure, and political stability. The mining code is not a star example but it works. There are some pretty good tax exemptions, says Peter Pelly, geologist for South Africa based Gencor which, with other firms, has joined a gold rush to West Africa. Exploration companies are given a customs duty waiver on imports but they say red tape delays securing the exemption. State participation in projects has waned however, with mining develpment arm SODEMI a candidate for privatisation. In the last year since the mining act a lot of companies have gone straight into ventures without Sodemi, says Gencor. Mining firms arriving in Ivory Coast in the early 's are still tied into joint ventures but benefit from years of mapping and prospection by SODEMI. Sodemi is improving as it gains more experience but at one stage we almost pulled out as the goal posts kept changing, said one geologist, citing problems over board representation. Other mining and investment laws give the state a free ride of percent of mining profits but allow firms to repatriate funds and dividends. Taxes are now levied at three percent of turnover rather than profits, while tax breaks apply for mining investments of million CFA or more. Processing time for permits of up to square km, valid for three years but renewable twice for two years, was slashed from over a year to a few weeks. The fiscal regime is also better but there needs to be more work on banking and accounts as well as uniform implementation of different mining code provisions, said one mine manager. Ivorian officials say relaxation of unwritten gold sales rules are being considered. Gold from SMI is currently marketed at spot rates through West Africa's central bank, BCEAO . We are paid the going gold rate but payments are often delayed, says Planque. We cannot raise loans against the gold or stabilise profits on the futures market, SMI, which is planning to open a new gold mine as part of a French BRGM and Australian Normandy Mining group, La Source, also wants clearer rules on illegal mining at its proposed site. At the moment there are too many, over , , artisanal miners from Liberia, Guinea and Mali, says Palanque. Abidjan newsroom,
