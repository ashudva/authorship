The drastic measures, even more severe than Wall Street had expected, were announced just four months after Dunlap known as Chainsaw Al for his deep cost cutting at troubled companies became chairman. The maker of Sunbeam and Oster appliances, patio furniture and gas grills, which just reported its first quarterly loss since , said it would also reduce the number of its facilities to from and take a charge of million for one time costs associated with the moves. The Fort Lauderdale, Fla. based firm, which lost . million in the third quarter as sales fell percent, did not specify when the charge would be taken. It did say, however, that only million of the charge would be in cash for the payment of severance and other employee costs, lease obligations and other plant costs. Sunbeam also announced ambitious plans for the future. It said it plans to double revenues to billion by and lift operating margins to percent of sales from the . percent posted for the first nine months of . Sunbeam also wants its return on equity to grow to percent from percent in the past year. Shrinking profit margins and high manufacturing and administrative costs have depressed the company's profits in recent years. Sunbeam earned . million in , less than half its profits. Sunbeam said it will sell or shut of facilities, including of its factories, leaving it just four factories in the United States and four overseas. In addition, warehouses will be cut to from . The company said it will sell several businesses, including those that make furniture, time and temperature devices, scales and decorative bedding. Sunbeam said its remaining businesses will be centered on kitchen appliances, personal care products, health care items, outdoor cooking equipment and professional care products. Our goal is to essentially complete the restructuring initiatives within the next days. Therefore, the company has every intention of meeting its previously stated goal of beginning as a new company, Dunlap said in a statement. Sales will double by to billion, he said. It will be vintage Dunlap, Dunlap said in a conference call with institutional investors and analysts. Dunlap declined to identify potential deal partners but said new products, including many designed for non U.S. markets, and other steps would yield percent or better year over year revenue growth. Dunlap, who was named chairman and chief executive officer in July, is credited with turning around Scott Paper Co., which was later sold to Kimberly Clark. At Scott Paper, Dunlap fired , workers and sold more than billion in assets.

Although restructuring annoucements usually boost a company's stock price, Sunbeam stock lost cents to in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange. He's pulled off some amazing turnarounds, Chapman Co. analyst Daniel Noll said of Dunlap. But I'm a little skeptical. I think the stock's a little ahead of itself. 'Chainsaw Al' is a pussycat name for you, analyst Andrew Shore of PaineWebber told Dunlap. If you pull this off, you should be called 'Nuclear Al.'
