GTE Corp. Wednesday said earnings rose percent in the third quarter, boosted by strong demand for new phone lines from people setting up businesses or hooking up computers at home. The results were in line with expectations, but GTE's stock jumped as investors cheered the report from the nation's largest local telephone company, as well a court ruling late on Tuesday that suspended key parts of federal rules designed to foster competition in local phone markets. Other local phone company stocks also rose after the ruling by a three judge appeals court panel in St. Louis. The judges said they had serious doubts about the Federal Communication Commission's authority to impose its pricing policies. The FCC rules, among other things, would require the Baby Bells and other local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at steep discounts of up to percent. Analysts said state regulators were likely to call for lower discounts. The appellate panel put the new rules on hold while it considers a court challenge to the FCC's plan. The challenge to the FCC rules had been spearheaded by GTE, which was joined by some of the Baby Bells, other local carriers and state regulators. The legal challenge improves the probability for getting higher prices to resell local networks than under the FCC guidance, said Bette Massick at brokers Bear Stearns.
