Kellogg Co. on Friday reported a drop of more than percent in its third quarter profits as its cereal volume dropped in an intensely competitive market. Kellogg, which makes Corn Flakes, Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Fruit Loops and Special K, is fighting back, launching marketing plans for the fourth quarter that are aimed at boosting its sales. We'll be taking what we believe are appropriate actions, Kellogg spokesman Richard Lovell said. The company, the world's biggest maker of ready to eat breakfast cereals, said its net income for the third quarter fell to . million, including a . million charge, from million a year ago. On a per share basis, Kellogg's earnings dropped percent to cents, with fewer shares outstanding, from . last year. Kellogg said its overall sales slipped percent to . billion from . billion as continued weak prices for breakfast cereals offset a percent gain in worldwide sales volume. As previously forecast, our third quarter performance was influenced significantly by competitive conditions in the U.S. cereal category, Kellogg Chairman Arnold Langbo said in a statement. Analysts estimate that Kellogg's domestic cereal sales volume fell percent to percent in the third quarter. We can't detail it. It was a challenging quarter in the U.S. and our volume was down, Lovell added. Kellogg said its fourth quarter earnings likely will show a slight rise from the cents it earned a year ago. First quarter earnings, however, may not match the cents earned in the period. It's a challenging comparison, Lovell said. Kellogg's stock fell on concern over U.S. cereal sales volume and the outlook for earnings, dropping at . a share, on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier, it set a new week low of . . Kellogg said the U.S. cereal market overall was sluggish, with sales growing about . percent, measuring grocery stores, mass merchandisers and all other outlets. Looking ahead, Kellogg refused to outline what promotional programmes it was planning for the fourth quarter. Analysts said they did not expect the Battle Creek, Mich. based cereal giant to return to deep discount coupons or buy one, get one free promotional giveaways. It's sort of left to speculation what they're going to do, SBC Warburg analyst Chris Jakubik said. There is no indication that, at this time, they have shifted from their long term strategic goal, which is to reduce inefficient promotions, added BT Securities analyst John O'Neil. Kellogg reduced prices on about two thirds of its breakfast cereals in June. Other major manufacturers also cut prices this year as they battled for market share and tried to jump start consumer purchases. But those price cuts alone apparently were not enough to jump start consumer purchases, according to Smith Barney analyst David Rabinowitz. The message there is that prices have to come down further, Rabinowitz said. According to Information Resources data, U.S. ready to eat cereal sales in grocery stores fell . percent to . billion pounds for the weeks ended Aug. , according to the most recent data available, compared with a year earlier. Kellogg's sales volume declined in that period by . percent to . million pounds for a market share of about . percent, Information Resources said.
