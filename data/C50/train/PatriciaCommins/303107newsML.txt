DeKalb gained a full market share point last year. The top seed corn supplier in the U.S. and Canada is Pioneer Hi Bred International Inc. In its swine operations, in which DeKalb sells breeding stock to farmers, Rauman said the first quarter results were below last year, primarily due to higher feed costs.
