Maytag Corp., boosted by its Hoover floor care line, said on Thursday its earnings for the fourth quarter more than doubled from a year ago as the company returned to profitability for the full year. Maytag said Hoover posted double digit gains in sales for the quarter and the year. Looking ahead, however, Maytag said it saw a slow start for its earnings in , as it shoulders marketing costs for several new products, including another Hoover upright floor cleaner, refrigerators and washing machines. Overall, we expect our earnings performance to start slowly but to pick up after mid year, when much of the sales and earnings impact from these product introductions will begin to be realised, Chairman Leonard Hadley said in a statement. The company said its profits were helped by lower raw material costs and four months of results from its joint venture partner in China, Hefei Rongshida, which is one of that country's leading washing machine manufacturers. The joint venture with RSD in China, which we announced in September , also contributed positively to the corporation's results, and we continue to be very enthusiastic about that business opportunity, Hadley said.

Maytag's brands also include Magic Chef and Admiral. Refrigeration sales in particular were weaker in due to competition and a sharp decline in private label sales to national accounts.
