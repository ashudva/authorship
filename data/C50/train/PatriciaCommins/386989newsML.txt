General Mills Inc, the number two U.S. cereal maker with a roughly percent market share, said Wednesday it expects record performance in fiscal . We expect to finish the year with record earnings, record volume and record market share, General Mills Chairman Stephen Sanger said in an interview here after a presentation at an analysts' conference. In fiscal , Minneapolis based General Mills earned . a share with sales of . billion. The company also reaped seven percent domestic volume growth and percent international volume growth in fiscal . For the first nine months of the year, General Mills, which makes cereals, Betty Crocker baking mixes, Hamburger Helper skillet dinner mixes, fruit snacks and yogurt, is expected to reach its volume target of four percent growth, Sanger added. As previously reported, General Mills expects a recent decline in cereal prices will reduce earnings for fiscal , which ends in May, by about . a share. Its recently completed acquisition of the branded cereal and snacks business of Ralcorp Holdings Inc, as previously disclosed, is expected to reduce earnings by about . a share. In the first half of fiscal , General Mills posted a profit of . a share, up one percent, and sales of . billion, up six percent. Earnings in the first half were relatively flat, Sanger said, partly because of the cereal price reduction, while sales benefited from some strong promotion. The second half will be a bit of the flip of that with modest volume growth, but stronger earnings, Sanger said. Looking ahead, Sanger said General Mills' goal continues to be to grow earnings per share over the long term, and to post a return on capital of at least percent. That's certainly what our goal will be for next year, he added. Reuter Chicago newsdesk
