General Mills Inc said Wednesday it expects a recovery in sales volume in the . billion U.S. ready to eat cereal market, in which it is the number two player.

In the past months, the total U.S. cereal category saw a . percent rise in physical sales volume, compared with growth of only . percent in the prior months. While Sanger declined to predict total cereal growth in the near term, he said he believes that domestic volume gains will move back toward that long term trend three percent category growth. Despite the recent slump in overall cereal sales, the U.S. ready to eat cereal market's per capita consumption has grown to . pounds in from . pounds in , Sanger said. While facing competition from other foods, cereal's share of the breakfast market grew over the past five years to nearly percent from . percent, he added. To combat sluggish cereal sales in prior years, U.S. cereal makers have cut prices and stepped up new product launches. Looking ahead, new products will continue to play an important roll in boosting company sales and expanding the U.S. cereal category, Sanger added. After launching Betty Crocker Dutch Apple and Cinnamon Streusel cereals last fall, General Mills will introduce one more cereal by the end of fiscal in May. General Mills said its cereals that are two years old or less, including its Frosted Cheerios, have a . percent market share. After its recently completed acquisition of branded cereals from Ralcorp Holdings Inc, General Mills gained about . percentage points of domestic market share, for a total of percent. While that deal narrowed the gap between General Mills and market leader Kellogg Co, which accounts for roughly one third of the U.S. cereal market, Sanger said he has no plans to make a run for the top spot. We're not fixated on somebody else's market share, Sanger said. They Kellogg have been a strong market leader...and they still are. There's every likelihood that their market share will grow in the future with the new products that they're bringing out. To boost sales of all its products ranging from cereal to Betty Crocker baking mixes and Hamburger Helper skillet dinner mixes General Mills will launch a marketing tie in in its fiscal fourth quarter with the release of The Lost World movie. General Mills said promotions will involve brands in the United States and Canada.
