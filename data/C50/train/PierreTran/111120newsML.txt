It does not have the same scope but it can be profitable. Communications, if it offers less spectacular potential, also holds less scope for risk, she added.

Lyonnaise executives declined to give sales or cashflow forecasts for its communications business but said most of the investment had already been made and it was adding services to the existing infrastructure.
