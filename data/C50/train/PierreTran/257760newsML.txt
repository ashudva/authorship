Partners in European aircraft consortium Airbus must speed up plans to convert the partnership into a single company after news of a merger between its two U.S. competitors, an aerospace executive said on Sunday. Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas announced a . billion merger plan which would create the world's largest aerospace firm, with sales of about billion and employing , people, dwarfing rival Airbus. The merger meant Airbus shareholders had to get their act together quickly , the executive said. Airbus is a consortium made up of France's Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc BAe , Daimler Benz Aerospace, a unit of Germany's Daimler Benz AG, and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA CASA of Spain. The European company has historically held around a percent share of the market, with Boeing holding around percent and McDonnell percent. Airbus expects to notch up firm orders for more than aircraft in , worth around billion, compared to sales last year, worth billion. Boeing said it has received orders for planes at the end of November. The Airbus partners, who are also Airbus subcontractors, are in talks on how to change the grouping into a joint stock company from the present groupement d'interet economique economic interest group partnership. The aim is to create a more competitive and responsive organisation. The need for the Europeans to integrate becomes more urgent, said the executive, who asked not to be identified. The merger move showed the arguments between partners are trivial . BAe's group managing director John Weston has said the future Airbus should be a large, integrated company with design offices and manufacturing and sales functions, and have a solid balance sheet to finance aircraft sales, to better rival Boeing. But Aerospatiale's chairman Yves Michot has said he sees the new Airbus as essentially a large prime contractor, directing its suppliers' work but retaining its design offices. Some executives see the design office as the heart of the business, with the ability to create new aircraft. Aerospatiale's design offices are in the southwestern French city of Toulouse, next to Airbus headquarters. Eventually, BAe wants Airbus to be the civilian arm of a huge pan European aerospace grouping, with a military wing to build future generations of combat planes, built from the national companies. But for the time being, the partners also need to resolve differences over the valuation and transfer of assets. Airbus officials in France declined comment. We can't comment on things happening in North America, a spokeswoman said. Officials at Aerospatiale were not available for comment. The Airbus negotiations slowed over the summer, when the French government moved the then chairman, Louis Gallois, to the helm of troubled state railway operator SNCF and promoted his number two, Yves Michot. A memorandum of understanding was due to be signed by the end of this year setting out the main lines of the new company but the industry executive said the talks are due to last up to March . U.S. broker Lehman Brothers has estimated Airbus could be worth between billion after its conversion, based on historical and prospective financial data. Previous major consolidation moves in the United States between fierce rivals such as Lockheed and Martin Marietta, and now Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, showed all that was needed was the ability to look ahead and for the political will to exist. The internal debate over the shape and scope of the future Airbus has run on for years, with managing director Jean Pierson a fervent enthusiast for an integrated company. The new Airbus company is supposed to be formed by the end of . The irony is that Airbus held merger talks with McDonnell Douglas in but the U.S. firm was stronger in those days and Airbus had not consolidated its position in the world market.
