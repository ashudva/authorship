Shares in French resorts company Club Mediterranee jumped almost percent on Monday as investors welcomed the appointment of the head of Euro Disney to the ailing holidays group. Club Med announced last Friday it was replacing its chairman Serge Trigano with Philippe Bourguignon, head of the Disneyland Paris theme park, and surprised the market with a net loss for the year of million francs . million . Bourguignon knows the business well. He has credibility...he is probably one of the best guys to choose, analyst Thibaut Simonnet at broker Ferri said. Bouguignon is credited with the turnround in the last two years of Disneyland Paris, which suffered initial heavy losses after opening in to hostile French media reports and an indifferent public. Club Med traded up percent to francs, on volume of , shares at GMT, while the market was up . percent. Bourguignon, who takes up the new post in March, has years' experience at hotels group Accor and gained valuable experience from Euro Disney, Simonnet said. Bouguignon's job at the theme park was probably made easier by the fact that Walt Disney Co held percent of Euro Disney. Simonnet forecast a pretax pre exceptional profit for Club Med in of million francs and held his buy recommendation on the company. That forecast still represented a weak operating margin of . percent on annual turnover of eight billion francs. Another French brokerage, Oddo, upgraded the stock to overweight from underweight and pointed out that Bourguignon had managed to triple gross operating profit at Euro Disney in three years and boosted sales by a fifth. Oddo upgraded its forecast earnings per share for to . francs from a previous estimated . francs, and . francs for from . . Bourguignon steps in at an opportune time as Club Med has set aside million francs in restructuring provisions to pay for the closure of seven holiday villages and head office job losses. The provisions will make it easier for Club Med to return to profit in , analysts said. It is simplifying its marketing by dropping the mid range Trident product and offering only the Club Med at the upper end of the market and Club Aquarius at the lower segment. It stands to make some money from the planned sale of a minority stake in an Italian business but will not get anything from disposing of its loss making cruise liners. The company still enjoys a strong brand and has a strong financial structure, with an acceptable debt equity ratio of percent. The expiry of a cross shareholding pact means the company is open to outsider investors. What remains to be seen is how the employees will react to the arrival of Bourguignon as a professional manager, in the place of Trigano, whose family founded the company and ran it as a family business even though it no longer owned Club Med. .
