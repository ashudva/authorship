High technology venture fund investment soared percent in the third quarter as overall U.S. venture investment rose percent in the seasonally slow period from year ago levels, according to a recent survey. It is so hot it's scary, Kirk Walden, who compiles the quarterly Price Waterhouse LLP National Venture Capital Survey, said in an interview. The survey was released Friday. High technology industries, from computer software and semiconductors to medical instruments, rose to . billion in the third quarter, accounting for two thirds of the billion invested during the period, the survey found. Software investments alone more than doubled from year ago levels to million, and in the first nine months of reached . billion, more than the . billion recorded for the sector in all of . For the first nine months of , total venture backed investments in the country reached billion, nearly the . billion reported for the full year last year. Based on the current rate of venture capital investments, will certainly be another record year, Donald McGovern, chairman of the Price Waterhouse Technology Industry Group, said in a statement accompanying the results. The third quarter total figure of billion was a sequential drop from the blistering . billion pace the industry recorded in the second quarter. Third quarter numbers are traditionally lower than second quarter numbers because deal flow slows considerably in the summer months, said Carl Thoma, president of the National Venture Capital Association. But the venture capital industry still remains strong. Good deals are being made across the country in all industries. Companies in the startup and early stages attracted the greatest level of venture capital investment, the study found, with these comprising percent of the companies receiving funds and accounting for million invested. On average, startup companies received more than . million in funding and communications firms accounted for nearly percent of the total invested in this category. Funding for Internet related companies continued at the high level set in the second quarter, with Internet related companies receiving funding in the quarter, exeeding the year ago period by six times. In a new trend, third quarter venture investment activity appeared to expand beyond the traditionally dominant Silicon Valley and New England areas, whose combined share of investment fell to percent of value invested. Typically, the two regions account for some to percent of the total amount invested by venture funds, and experts said it confirms a trend towards more even distribution.
