Undeterred by recent market worries over the networking sector, Cisco Systems Inc chief executive John Chambers said he continued to see the industry's overall business growing at a brisk clip in . We see a very good market at to percent growth for the forseeable future, Chambers told Reuters in an interview after a conference call with analysts in which he repeated Cisco's goal of outperforming the market's growth. Cisco's second quarter results narrowly beat Wall Street estimates, rebuffing market talk on Tuesday of a shortfall. Cisco reported that net income rose nearly percent to . million in its second quarter to January compared with . million a year earlier. Net sales rose percent to . billion from . million a year earlier. Analysts said Cisco's pro forma net income of . million, or . a share, excluding an acquisition related writeoff and a net gain from sale of an investment, topped First Call's mean analysts estimate of . a share and roughly equalled Wall Street's . . whisper number. Chambers said the firm expected to acquire another to companies in its current year. Almost every market segment has opportunity for internal products, joint development projects with our partners and acquisitions, he told Reuters. Cisco shares, which had ended the Nasdaq market session down at before the results were released, slid as low as in after market trade. Some analysts attributed the decline to concerns the company's post exceptional . a share earnings number had fallen short of expectations. Analysts said Cisco executives in their conference call had addressed concerns over a possible slowing in the market, sparked by comments attributed to rival Com Corp. Several analysts said they saw no sign that any December sluggishness observed by Com had a major impact on Cisco's business. I think it was another good solid quarter from Cisco. No hint of any problems, said Paul Saunders of Van Kasper amp Co. Chambers said a shortening of order lead times down to one to three weeks now from eight to weeks previously meant quarterly shifts in results may be more pronounced. He repeated previous comments that sometime in the future, we'll see a quarter that is in single digit growth. Analysts said sequential growth in revenues from one quarter to the next such as the second quarter's more than percent rise from the first fiscal quarter would still provide sharp year on year increases. A second quarter gross margin of . percent surprised some analysts who had been expecting price competition to cut into margins. But Chambers said Our overall guidance is over time...margins will continue to go down. There will be a few quarters up, but I think most of them will be down, hopefully just slightly. Smith Barney analyst Therese Murphy noted Cisco's third quarter tended to be weak, but saw no reason to be any more cautious than we normally would be in the April quarter. Chambers did not see any fundamental industry change, and continued to target growth above the industry rate while taking advantage of further consolidation, she said.
