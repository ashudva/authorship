Netscape Communications Corp. on Wednesday raised the ante in the Internet software wars, announcing a price increase effective April as it prepares to release new products this spring. Netscape also introduced a five level support program, beginning next month, which allows customers to pick the level of service they are willing to pay for. The price of Communicator, the integrated communications package which includes Netscape's Navigator browser, will rise to from , the Mountain View, Calif. based company said. Its enterprise server software, used on the server computers that run networks, will cost , , up from . Under the new pricing, Netscape will charge an average percent to percent more for service, it said. But, by delaying the price increases until April , Netscape has made a pre release version of Communicator a more attractive buy and positioned itself for higher sales this quarter, executives said. People who pay now for the software, which is available in a preview version, will be able to get the final version for free when it becomes available in the next quarter. Michael Homer, Netscape's vice president of marketing, said the new prices still offer a better deal than rival products from Microsoft Corp. and the Lotus Development Corp. unit of International Business Machines Corp.. Lotus President Jeff Papows quickly challenged that and accused Netscape executives of childish behavior in making pricing comparisons that Papows said were misleading. There's very little difference in the price points, actually, Papows said after making a presentation to a Goldman Sachs conference at which Netscape's vice president of engineering, Eric Hahn, disclosed the price increases. Our servers are much cheaper to acquire, he said, noting that Lotus Domino server software is priced at , compared with Netscape's SuiteSpot . , which allows customers to chose five of its nine server products for , , or , after April . A Microsoft executive also disputed Netscape's pricing claim. Our browser and our server are still free, so we've got to be less expensive, said Mike Nash, a marketing director in the company's personal and business systems group. Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser is free for all platforms, and its Internet Information Service is included as a feature of the Windows NT Server operating systems for large networks. The three companies are competing fiercely in the fast growing market for electronic mail, scheduling and so called workgroup software for intranets, the corporate networks that make use of cost effective Internet technologies. Netscape stock rose . cents to . , and Microsoft climbed . to . , both on the Nasdaq market. IBM rose . cents to . on the New York Stock Exchange. Homer said a configuration for , users combining Communicator and Netscape's server software only costs per user computer just a user for those already using Navigator compared to for Lotus. But Papows contested this, saying the true list price figure would be around , or roughly the same. They are quoting irrelevent data, doing it deliberately, and posting it to their Web site, he said, adding he recently discussed his concerns with Homer and Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale. The Lotus executive added, however, that he expects the market for all players to continue to expand briskly, with Lotus aiming to increase the number of electronic mail users of its software by up to . million this year to million. We're doing enormously well. I suspect they're doing well, too. There's a big market, he said, adding Netscape ought to be well credited for invigorating the Internet market. Homer said Netscape's price advantage was even greater, according to recent studies by third parties, when the total cost of acquiring, installing and using its systems was taken into account, including training and other factors.
