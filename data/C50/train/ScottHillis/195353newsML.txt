A decade ago, Chinese publishers were still putting type in place by hand, painstakingly selecting one character at a time from thousands of inky stereotypes. Then in , Wang Xuan, a professor of computer science at Beijing University, created a software programme to represent Chinese fonts on a computer. Today, nearly all of China's newspapers are printed using Wang's Electronic Publishing System, a product of the Founder Group Corp that he helped the university launch. Our Chinese word processing software was far ahead of foreign products, that's why we took the leading market position at a stroke, Wang told Reuters in an interview.

But Wang insists similarities to the American software guru are limited. The difference is huge. Bill Gates is , I am almost . I am past my creative peak, Wang said. The entrepreneur notes other differences. Like many Chinese his age, Wang lived through the tumultuous early years after the communist revolution in .
