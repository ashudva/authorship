Equitas, created to run off Lloyd's of London's huge pre losses, on Monday received as expected only a qualified opinion on its first set of accounts. The development underlined the difficulties Equitas faces in unwinding . billion pounds billion of liabilities which had threatened to destroy the Lloyd's market. Equitas chairman David Newbigging described its initial five months of operation as a case of so far, so good as the company released first details of its financial position since it was given the green light last September. But auditors Coopers amp Lybrand cited 'significant uncertainties' about the accuracy of provisions relating to claims outstanding, reinsurers' share of those and reinsurance recoveries. Claims experience was likely to differ from estimated liability, potentially to a 'material degree', it said, warning that if adjustments were necessary they could wipe out shareholders funds of million pounds. That threat was well flagged in the Lloyd's settlement offer document last year, however, and the company expressed little surprise at the position taken by the auditors. Obviously no company likes to see an audit qualification... There are fundamental uncertainties associated with the type of liability we've got and I think we'll have some mention of it in audit qualifications probably forever, said Equitas finance director Jane Barker. However, she said the group would be looking to remove another problem highlighted by Coopers, that of data quality, as quickly as possible. While it would continue to be a feature of Equitas' first trading period through March , the objective is to remove or substantially reduce it by March . Equitas was formed to allow a line to be drawn under Lloyd's near disastrous pre losses. Its creation was a central plank in Lloyd's 'Reconstruction and Renewal' R amp R plan, freeing Names from their exposure to the eight billion pounds of losses accumulated between and . The payment of claims and expenses by syndicates last year had reduced Equitas' reinsurance premium to . billion pounds by the time it began operating in September, down from a figure set at . billion pounds based on year end figures. The company said that by September the group had assets totalling billion pounds and net claims reserves of . billion pounds. But the surplus between the Equitas premium and the value of discounted liabilities had been reduced from the projected surplus of million pounds as at year end to million pounds in September. Newbigging said Equitas had two clearly defined objectives to secure true finality for reinsured Names individuals with unlimited liability who traditionally supported Lloyd's and to create a sufficient surplus to enable some return of the premium to them but that neither of these targets would be easy. However, there had been no major surprises so far, he said, and the position of the group today was much as we anticipated at the time we became operational . The company expects total group liabilities to halve over the next three or four years but asbestos, pollution and health claims, all long tail and notoriously difficult to assess, make up some percent of Equitas' discounted liabilities and are expected to take up to years to run off. While any surplus over eventual liabilities, can be returned to Names, that was unlikely to occur within the next three, four or five years according to Newbigging. . British Pounds
