John Rew, co founder of publisher and market analyst Chatset, has invited Names the traditional backers of Lloyd's to fund a feasibility study on whether a Name owned company could be floated to re insure orphan syndicates. Rew, is seeking to raise , pounds , , one third of which will be devoted to the study. If successful, a prospectus will be issued to set up the syndicate. There are around , Names trapped on more than syndicates for which are still open because of the uncertainty surrounding eventual liabilities. Normally the year would have closed at the end of . Until they do, none of the Names can formally leave Lloyd's. In order to close a syndicate, Lloyd's requires that the reinsurance be backed by another syndicate.

But Equitas did not take on orphan syndicates. Once orphan syndicates have been reinsured, the names' deposit can be released. In the case of ceased or resigned Names, who may comprise as many as half the , , Lloyd's requires percent of the 'stamp capacity' to be backed by deposit, which Rew estimates could mean up to million pounds trapped within Lloyd's. .
