The stock of IBM, years ago dubbed I've Been Mugged, is back in style and hitting historic highs on Wall Street, where investors say shares of the world's biggest computer company can continue rising. The rally in International Business Machines Corp. stock started on Friday when an influential analyst, Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch, raised his month price target on IBM to from about .

When IBM was losing money and restructuring, and after its first dividend cuts in , the stock sank as low as and gained the moniker of I've Been Mugged on Wall Street. Now, with a steady stream of profits and many bullish opinions by analysts, some analysts are again viewing the stock as a bellwether that is also helping fuel the rally in the Dow Jones industrial average. One question now hounding investors is whether it would be wise to jump in and buy Big Blue, or wait for the stock to decline. Market technicians and some analysts who follow IBM say that the once beleaguered stock still has room to climb. Some analysts still have buy ratings on IBM, even at these levels, because its value remains low relative to many other technology stocks, a point IBM officials have tried to bring home to investors in recent months.

At these levels there really isn't much resistance, this can continue to work higher, said Susan Stern, a senior technical analyst at Smith Barney. Resistance refers to a price ceiling where a stock price consolidates. I think the primary trend remains up, said Gregory Nie, a technical analyst at EVEREN Securities Inc. The stock is getting a little extended on a short term basis.
