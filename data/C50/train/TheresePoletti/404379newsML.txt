AT amp T Corp. a year after the much hyped launch of its Internet access service had consumers clamouring for software said Wednesday it will end its introductory offer of free Internet access to long distance customers. The telecommunications giant said that after March a revised pricing plan for its WorldNet Service will go into effect, but that it will continue to offer its flat rate pricing plan of . a month for unlimited access. AT amp T also said it began posting statistics about the reliability and performance of WorldNet.
