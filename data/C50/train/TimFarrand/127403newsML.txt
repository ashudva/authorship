Britain's Lloyds Chemists said on Friday it was unable to advise shareholders what action to take on a renewed bid offer from UniChem until it had heard from rival suitor Gehe AG. What we will now need to do is to see if we can ascertain Gehe's intentions, finance director Johnathan Fellows said in an interview. Both UniChem's original bid for the pharmacy chain and a rival offer from German pharmaceutical wholesaler Gehe AG lapsed in March after being referred to Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of competition fears. We have no comment at this stage. We need to meet as a board and we clearly need to have some correspondence with our shareholders. We have not yet resolved what recommendations to make, Fellows said. I would hope to make an announcement in the next few days.

Gehe shares trading in Frankfurt were off two marks at marks. Gehe, whose lapsed offer was an all cash bid pitched at pence per share, said it planned an announcement later in the day.

UniChem also said it had identified cost savings and revenue benefits conservatively estimated at more than million pounds in the months after an acquisition and in excess of million pounds a year thereafter. As well as cost savings UniChem said the acquisition would enable faster development of its retail pharmacy business and be earnings enhancing after months. We believe that our extensive retail expertise, together with our unparalleled pharmaceutical wholesale distribution capabilities, will greatly enhance both businesses, said Jeffery Harris, chief executive of UniChem. The offer was announced shortly after Britain's Department of Trade and Industry DTI cleared the way for a takeover of Lloyds, providing UniChem and Gehe fulfill promises to sell off certain parts of Lloyds. UniChem and GEHE have each identified a number of potential firm buyers for the businesses they are required to divest. These have been approved by the minister, said the DTI. If either UniChem or Gehe are successful in acquiring Lloyds, they must sell off specified Lloyds' wholesale businesses within three months of the completed merger, the department said.
