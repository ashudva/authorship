Brewer to leisure group Whitbread Plc should report a percent rise in first half earnings on Tuesday, kicking off the reporting season for drinks companies with a rosy picture of consumer spending on the high street this summer. Analysts estimate pretax profits for the six months to the end of August in a range of million, against . million last time. Dividend forecasts range from . to . p, up from . p. It's been a good performance in the summer. Consumer spending has picked up and on the beer side, they moved to higher margin premium beer. And you will see their acquisitions adding some benefit, said Ron Littleboy, analyst at Nomura. Whitbread acquired health and sports club group David Lloyd Leisure for about million stg and chain of Marriott hotels in Britain for some million in August . If there is a surprise, it is probably on the upside and if that is going to come from anywhere, it would be on the hotels side, said John Beaumont, analyst at Merrill Lynch. The Whitbread hotel company includes about budget Travel Inns, where new openings are running at a rate of about one every two weeks, and Marriott hotels. The main growth will come on retail and leisure and what will pull them back is their leased pub side, said Littleboy. WHitbread manages about , pubs mainly on year leases. The restaurant and leisure division includes TGI Friday, Pizza Hut, percent owned by Pepsico, Costa Coffee, Thresher and Beefeater. Whitbread Inns, the managed pubs side of the business, includes Brewers Fayre which leads the casual dining out sector. The company announced an agreed million stg bid for Pelican Group of cafes in July including Cafe Rouge and Dome urban, French style bistros which the company said would not contribute to earnings this financial year. One of the main variables that influences our future profit estimates is how quickly will they be expanding on the leisure and pub side, said Beaumont. And provided the company is still fairly sanguine on the roll out programme for these concepts, that will gives us a lot of reassurance. Some analysts are also keen to get a view from the company about the impact of a minimum wage for its workforce on its earnings the opposition Labour Party widely expected to win the forthcoiming general election has pledged it will introduce a national minimum wage.
