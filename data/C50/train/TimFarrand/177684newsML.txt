I gritted myself for something rather unpleasant and its turned out very well, said David Lang, an analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite. The shares jumped p in early London trade to , p after profits rose to million pounds . billion for the quarter. The results beat analysts' forecasts which ranged from million pounds to million. I think there is quite a lot of momentum in Unilever and that is before the benefits of management reorganisation which began in September, said Lang. Before an exceptional charge of million pounds, mostly to reshape its newly acquired industrial cleaning business Diversey, pretax profits rose six percent to million.

Unilever owns a range of household brands including washing detergent OMO, Brooke Bond tea, Ponds cosmetic cream and several ice cream products.

Despite the impact of a dull summer on ice cream sales and profits, Unilever still managed to improve its profit by million pounds to million in the three month period from improved profits in detergents, frozen foods and personal products. The real strength came from the emerging markets of Latin America and Asia Pacific and the strong underlying performance in North America, added Haines. The Asia Pacific region turned in a million pounds increase in profits to million in the third quarter, Latin America was up million pounds at million, while Africa and the Middle East showed a nine million rise to million pounds, reflecting changes made by the group to its Nigerian business. .
