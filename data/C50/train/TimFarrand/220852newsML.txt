British sugar and starch producer Tate and Lyle reported an percent fall in full year profits to million pounds million on Wednesday after an earnings drop of more than percent at its U.S. subsidiary Staley. But the company's shares rose pence to after touching as company executives made positive noises about the current trading environment for corn miller Staley, with corn prices now at more normal levels and demand rising for ethanol, which is extracted from the corn. The price of corn now at . a bushel has settled after a much larger crop this summer of . billion bushels, Tate chief executive Larry Pillard told Reuters in an interview. I would like to think futures prices will stay at about . a bushel. At this time last year they were up by percent at . and as high as five dollars a bushel at mid year. That's unprecedented, the highest price for years, he said. Staley was severely squeezed last year. On the one hand by very high corn prices, which doubled after a low U.S. corn crop, and increased competition from new producers of high fructose corn syrup and on the other hand by its inability to pass this added cost onto customers. Conditions have reversed this year so that corn milling companies can divert some of their excess capacity into ethanol and that could tighten up the market a bit, he added. Ethanol, a gasoline substitute, can also be made by corn millers but the price of gasoline was so low last year that this option was closed. Gasoline prices have averaged cents a gallon so far this year, reaching a peak of . in April, up from cents a gallon in . I think that obviously the world grain situation getting back to more normal levels is encouraging, the re emergence of ethanol is quite encouraging and the three percent increase in sugar deliveries in the U.S. is quite encouraging, said Pillard. Staley, which produces high fructose corn syrup used as sweeteners in Coca Cola and Pepsi drinks, renegotiates supply contracts with soft drinks firms at the beginning of every calender year. Pillard said it was too early to comment on the next round of contracts. It looks like Staley has finally hit the bottom of the cycle, said one analyst who declined to be named. Tate benefited in the last quarter of the year from a recovery in the U.S. sugar market where the selling price of white sugar rose after a low U.S. beet crop reduced supplies. Cane raw sugar costs declined as supplies of cane raw sugar rose due to increases in the import quota.
