Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, demerged from Hanson Plc in October, said on Thursday it's future was bright although British market growth was tough due to escalating taxes on cigarettes. In Britain it is difficult to see the market growing given the punitive taxes. We are likely to see continued strong growth, though, in the Asia Pacific area of the world, chief executive Gareth Davis said in an interview. Imperial posted trading profits of million pounds . million from Britain in the year ended September , unchanged from its level, but profits from overseas grew percent to million. Overall group profits before tax for the year were up five percent at million pounds. The company's shares rose p to p. Britain's Finance Minister, Kenneth Clarke, announced an increase of p on a packet of cigarettes in his November budget. After a similar rise in , British cigarette sales fell by . percent and Davis said he expected the same sort of fall again. He said the latest tax rise would fuel smuggling by widening further the gap between taxes in Britain and mainland Europe. The company's profits from overseas, which now make up percent of total group profits, are targeted to reach percent by the end of the decade, said Davis.

We have very strong defences and great confidence in those defences and we will defend each and any claim aganst us with the upmost vigour.
