David Jones, chief executive of British fashion retailer Next Plc, on Monday rejected as nonsense press reports that he had been approached by headhunters to take over the top job at Sears. Some shareholders at stores group Sears are disgruntled with the dismal performance of the group and are calling for a radical shake up including a demerger of its very profitable Selfridges department store and the sale of the struggling British Shoe Corporation. Sears was back in the spotlight last week when it issued a profit warning and reported disappointing Christmas sales, leading to suggestions that chief executive Liam Strong's job was on the line. The Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported that Jones was offered the job of chief executive of Sears but had decided to turn it down. But Jones told Reuters in an interview on his carphone, I'm very happy in my current job. I am not intending to leave Next. As far as I am concerned no one is headhunting me for any job. Although Sears sold its mail order business Freemans earlier this month to Littlewoods LWD.CN for million pounds million and pledged to return about million in cash to shareholders in six months' time, some investors are calling for deeper changes. Sears shares, which traded at p on Monday, have underperformed the stockmarket by over percent since Strong took the helm five years ago. Jones is accredited with rescuing Next from the brink of collapse in the early s in the midst of Britain's deepest recession since the second world war by combining a sell off programme of non core assets, such as mail order business Grattan, and a sharper focus on the main brand. He sold shops and merged others, improving the Next profile on the high street and reducing shoppers' confusion about the range and type of products on sale.
