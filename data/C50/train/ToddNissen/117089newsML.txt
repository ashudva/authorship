General Motors Corp., facing a rancorous strike by its Canadian workers, Tuesday reported a . billion third quarter profit that was boosted by strong automotive results and an unsually low income tax rate. The world's largest automaker said the combined net income of its North American Automotive Operations and its Delphi Automotive Systems parts businesses was million. A year ago, the operations had a combined loss of million, while the parent company posted a profit of . million. Increased volume and favourable currency exchange rates helped GM to nearly triple its international operations profits to million from million a year ago.

GM Chief Financial Officer Michael Losh told reporters during a conference call that rate is expected to return to the percent range in the fourth quarter. As it has all year, GM continued to add to its growing cash account in the third period, contributing another . billion to bring its total cash balance to . billion at the end of the quarter. Because GM has previously set its cash goal at billion, Ronald Glantz, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, believes the GM board will return some of that money to shareholders. I thought it was a pretty decent quarter, he said. I have a lot more confidence that they are going to raise the dividend and announce a share repurchase programme.

The company also lost share in the U.S. car and truck market, finishing the quarter with . percent compared with . percent. GM delivered , , vehicles in the United States during the quarter, down from , , . But CFO Losh said the overall volume increase represented good news for the company, and was a sign there is demand for the bevy of new models it is launching. It's volume that drives earnings, not market share, per say, he said. Another positive sign was the pace of new model launches, said Losh. Production of full size vans at Wentzvile, Mo., and Saturn coupes in Spring Hill, Tenn., have reached full line speed, and other plants are on schedule. GM is in the midst of launching new cars and trucks. In the third quarter, the company had nine plants actively involved in changeovers. Losh said that is the most it expects to have in a given quarter, adding GM will have seven in changeovers in the fourth quarter. However, one of those nine plants is a facility in Oshawa, Ontario, which is the target of a strike by Canadian Auto Workers. Losh declined to say how much the strike will set back the new model launch there. Losh also declined to comment on status of talks between both the CAW and United Auto Workers. About , CAW members began walking off the job Oct. over the issue of outsourcing the use of outside contractors. GM also has yet to reach a new labour pact with the UAW. On Tuesday, the number of U.S. workers idled by the strike rose to , from , on Monday.
