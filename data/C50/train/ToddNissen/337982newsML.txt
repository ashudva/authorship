Clearly our fourth quarter and calendar year results were impacted by the strike related production losses in the United States and Canada and are not indicative of GM's potential for continued profit improvement, GM Chairman John Smith said.

GM's fourth quarter results included several one time accounting items, including a million loss on the sale of four Delphi parts plants to Peregrine Inc. and a million charge for lump sum payments to UAW members as part of its new labour contract. Including the strike related effects, the one time items brought down GM's fourth quarter earnings by million, or cents a share. However, the fourth quarter also included a separate, favourable tax gain of million.

In his statement, Smith also blamed the lower results on production changeovers, higher advertising and consumer influence expenses related to new product launches.
